I talked to people in western New York who said they\u2019re furloughing nurses in hospitals in western New York state, while people in New York City are suffering. We need to make sure we get the right resources to the right people, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to doing.\"\n\nWe wondered whether his statement that Western New York hospitals are furloughing nurses is true.\n\nA spokesperson for Dr. Adams said the surgeon general heard about furloughs from a doctor in the Rochester area.\n\n\"The surgeon general spoke with a Rochester-area physician earlier this week, who shared that information,\" said Jennifer Sherman, director of public affairs in the Office of the Surgeon General. \"The point Dr. Adams was making is that in some states we are seeing a mismatch of resources, where one city may have more resources but fewer cases, and another city may have few resources but an abundance of cases. It's important states are coordinating with local jurisdictions and providers so they have the resources they need, and that is something the federal government is helping facilitate - in addition to deploying resources from the Strategic National Stockpile and FEMA.\"\n\nWe reached out to the doctor, who declined to speak with us on the record.\n\nHospitals say no furloughs\n\nWe reached out to hospitals to see if they know of any nursing furloughs in Western New York hospitals. None knew of any.\n\nRochester\u2019s two major health systems, which operate most hospitals in the Rochester region, said they are not furloughing nurses.\n\nRochester Regional Health, which operates Rochester General Hospital and four others in surrounding communities, has not furloughed any nurses.\n\n\"We are in the process of redeploying resources which includes nurses,\" said Public Information Officer Veronica Chiesi Brown. \"This means they are taken from one area and moved to another based on need. Nurses are a critical resource right now and we need more, not less.\"\n\nUniversity of Rochester Medicine, which operates Strong Memorial Hospital and six others in the Rochester region, may have nurses at home because they could be infected, but none are on furlough.\n\n\"A small number of staff members who are symptomatic are staying home pending test results, but no furloughs are taking place in UR Medicine\u2019s hospitals or ambulatory practices,\" said Chip Partner, assistant vice president for communications.\n\nIn addition, Monroe County government and Rochester\u2019s two major hospital systems on Friday unveiled a plan to double its hospital capacity. The plan includes hiring more clinicians, including doctors and nurses.\n\nThe Genesee Valley Nurses Association, a professional organization for registered nurses in seven counties in the Rochester area, had not heard of any furloughs, said Nancy Iafrati, who is on the organization\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates medical centers in Buffalo, Batavia, and Canandaigua, are not furloughing nurses, and are looking to re-hire VA nurses who have retired, said Christina Mandreucci, press secretary for the department.\n\nIn Buffalo, major hospitals are hiring nurses, preparing for a surge of Covid-19 patients. Kaleida Health, which operates Buffalo General Medical Center and Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital, among others health care facilities, said it is hiring nurses. So is Erie County Medical Center. Catholic Health, which operates hospitals in Buffalo and recently opened a facility solely dedicated to treating coronavirus patients, has posted \"a call to service\" on its employment web page, seeking nurses, respiratory therapists and others.\n\nA statewide professional organization said it is aware of furloughs of nurse anesthetists in New York State, because elective procedures have been canceled in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. The organization has sent a survey to its members to find out how many of those furloughs have occurred, said Stephanie Grolemund, president of the New York State Association of Nurse Anesthetists.\n\nElsewhere in the country, there have been reports of furloughed health care workers, either because of exposure to the virus or because the organizations they work for depend on income from elective procedures and office visits, which have been postponed in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any evidence of furloughs of nurses in Western New York.

Infection fatality rates that may seem small can lead to mounting death tolls.\n\nIt\u2019s misleading to compare, as Carlson did, the early reported case fatality rates, which reflect deaths among confirmed COVID-19 patients, with more recent infection fatality rates that estimate the death rate for all infected people.\n\nReputable scientists warned early in the outbreak that there was not a totally accurate picture of how deadly the coronavirus was. There\u2019s still not.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson railed against continued statewide shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, claiming in a recent TV segment that they did little to flatten the curve and that \"the virus just isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.\"\n\nCiting recent studies from hotspots such as New York, Carlson said the virus is \"a full order of magnitude less deadly\" than public health officials warned.\n\n\"The virus just isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as we thought it was, all of us, including on this show,\" he said. \"Everybody thought it was, but it turned out not to be.\"\n\nMore than 65,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s in spite of widespread mitigation efforts to reduce the spread. So how deadly is it?\n\nEstimating the lethality of COVID-19 has been a key question for epidemiologists. In the middle of a pandemic, moving targets make the death rate difficult to pin down.\n\nBut experts told us Carlson\u2019s statement is off-track. Many early mortality estimates were based on official counts of confirmed cases, but epidemiologists were consistent in saying those raw numbers didn\u2019t reflect the virus\u2019s deadliness with complete precision.\n\nThe numbers can be confusing\n\nIdeally, epidemiologists could divide the number of deaths by the number of infections to calculate what\u2019s known as the \"infection fatality rate.\" But there\u2019s no way to get a complete count of the number of infected individuals, largely because so many mild cases go unreported.\n\nJeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said there could be as many as 12.5 COVID-19 infections for every confirmed case in the U.S.\n\nStill, scientists work with the data they have, even if it\u2019s evolving and varies with patient demographics and location. Some of the first widely reported death rates were what are called \"case fatality rates,\" which are calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of reported cases.\n\nOn March 3, for example, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died \u2014 a case fatality rate.\n\nExperts told us at the time that the 3.4% was only a snapshot, and one that likely undercounted people with mild symptoms. A WHO spokesperson said it would \"change over time.\"\n\nThe global case fatality rate has actually risen since then. As of May 3, the WHO had tallied 3,349,786 confirmed cases worldwide and 238,628 deaths, for a case fatality rate of about 7%.\n\nNow, tests for antibodies in the blood of people exposed to the coronavirus are offering the first glimpses at what the infection fatality rate could be in states such as New York and California.\n\nThe tests haven\u2019t all been as accurate as many experts would like, and the studies of them haven\u2019t all been peer-reviewed. \"It remains very clear that we do not know the precise mortality of COVID-19 infection,\" said the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s Myron Cohen.\n\nBut their preliminary results suggested the infection fatality rate may be below 1%, handing fodder to some who say the COVID-19 threat is overblown.\n\nCarlson said the new information shows COVID-19 is less deadly than expected.\n\nOn his show, he cited widely disputed findings from two California doctors. A Fox News spokesperson also pointed to a White House press conference, a JP Morgan chart, and recent antibody studies in California and New York to support it.\n\nBut Shaman, the epidemiologist, said Carlson was \"cherry-picking evidence.\"\n\nMany early figures were case fatality rates, while the estimates reported as a result of recent antibody studies are infection fatality rates. They shouldn\u2019t be conflated, Shaman said.\n\nSeemingly small infection fatality rates can also cause mounting deaths. The New York study showed the state\u2019s infection fatality rate to be around 0.5%, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\n\nThat matches estimates from a model Shaman constructed, which he said put the U.S. infection fatality rate at 0.56%. But in a worst-case scenario where 70% of Americans are infected, a 0.5% rate could amount to 1.2 million U.S. deaths, Shaman said.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve reported, the death toll may be higher than we know.\n\nThe infection fatality rate for the flu, which kills thousands of Americans annually, hovers under 0.1% and is calculated annually using a mathematical model that estimates the disease burden.\n\nCarlson\u2019s sources aren\u2019t foolproof\n\nThere are other problems with Carlson\u2019s sources, including the clip he played of one of two California physicians who gained national attention for calling to end the shutdowns.\n\nThe doctors, who own an urgent care clinic, used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinic to extrapolate to the entire state and put the death rate at a tiny 0.03%.\n\nThe University of Washington\u2019s Carl Bergstrom wrote on Twitter that this amounts to \"sampling bias\" because patients at an urgent care clinic likely think they\u2019re sick. The doctors\u2019 calculations are like \"estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court,\" he said.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that during a pandemic, the people who come into an urgent care clinic are not a random sample of the population.\n\n\n\nA large fraction of them are coming in precisely because they suspect that they have the disease.\n\n\n\nThis generates sampling bias. \u2014 Carl T. Bergstrom (@CT_Bergstrom) April 26, 2020\n\nThe video was \"emphatically condemn(ed)\" by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine; it was also removed from YouTube.\n\nAnother report cited by the Fox News spokesperson, from the University of Southern California, followed a controversial study from Stanford University.\n\nA number of experts have since warned that both studies used antibody tests known to yield false positive results. (A USC spokesperson said results were adjusted to account for that.)\n\nMany epidemiologists said the infection fatality rate would be lower\n\nCarlson\u2019s claim that COVID-19 was projected to be deadlier for infected patients also discounts what many experts said months ago.\n\n\"No one knowledgeable thought it was as deadly as known deaths divided by known cases,\" said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\"Every responsible epidemiologist has been saying that the number of cases is certainly more than those we know about, especially in the U.S., where testing has been inadequate.\"\n\nMany experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said preliminary case fatality rates could be inflated. The WHO said early on, including in mid- February, that the infection fatality rate would be lower than the initial case fatality rates.\n\nThe Imperial College of London, which projected in March that the U.S. could see 2.2 million deaths if it had no response, estimated that 0.9% of infected COVID-19 patients would die.\n\n\"It is surprisingly mild only to those who were not listening to competent epidemiologists, and it is in fact considerably worse than seasonal flu,\" Lipsitch said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCarlson said the coronavirus \"just isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.\"\n\nScientists warned early in the outbreak that the raw number of confirmed cases didn\u2019t give a fully accurate picture of mortality.\n\nIt\u2019s misleading for Carlson to compare early case fatality rates \u2014 which divide the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases \u2014 with newer estimates of the infection fatality rate. The infection fatality rate should be lower, as experts have said for months.\n\nIt\u2019s premature to say as a matter of fact that a far rosier picture has emerged.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "date": "2020/04/27", "false_statement": " \u201cThe (corona)virus just isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Reputable scientists warned early in the outbreak that there was not a totally accurate picture of how deadly the coronavirus was.

In November 1982, he said President Ronald Reagan had undermined confidence in America\u2019s global leadership.\n\n\"There's not that assured feeling now that our country is in the forefront of peace, nuclear arms control, human rights and environmental concern that it was before,\" Carter said in a news conference.\n\nAt the same event, Carter chastised Reagan for faulting Carter for the problems Reagan faced.\n\n\"There is always the temptation for an incumbent politician to blame all his mistakes on his predecessor,\" Carter said. \"Most are willing to withstand the temptation. Mr. Reagan, apparently, is not.\"\n\nThe idea that Obama is the first president to criticize his successor has been around since at least 2018, when Snopes found it false, citing Presidents George H.W.

The plague will hit New York City and shake it like it has never been shaken. The plague is going to force prayerless believers into radical prayer and into their Bibles and repentance will be the cry from the man of God in the pulpit. And out of it will come a third Great Awakening that will sweep America and the world.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Wilkerson, who died in 2011, actually made this prediction.\n\nPolitiFact reached out to the Times Square Church, the non-denominational church that Wilkerson established in 1987, and a spokesperson there said, \"The church is not aware of Pastor David ever writing that in any of his books or sermons.\"\n\nWe did not receive a response to multiple inquiries to the Jerusalem Prayer Team. The Facebook post instructs readers to click on a link, where they can find video, transcript and a prophetic message from Evans as well as the \"entire prophecy from David Wilkerson.\" That page then instructs readers to enter their email address to receive a free speech by Evans where he shares Wilkerson\u2019s prediction.\n\nThe speech says Evans met Wilkerson for breakfast in 1986 at an Embassy Suites hotel near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in Texas. There, according to Evans, Wilkerson predicted a plague so strong that it would shut down restaurants and bars in New York City.\n\nEvans writes that Wilkerson pointed him to the Bible\u2019s Old Testament Book of Isaiah, where it says that \"every house will be shut up, and no one will be coming or going. The city of confusion is broken down, and every house is shut up that no man may come in.\"\n\nThe book of Isaiah, which Judeo-Christian tradition holds was written by a prophet by the same name, does address a plague that forces people to stay inside and shuts down an economy. But it doesn\u2019t explicitly point to the coronavirus hitting New York City. Chapter 24 is believed to describe the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah due to man\u2019s inability to follow God\u2019s covenant.\n\nEvans is promoting his new book, \"A Great Awakening is Coming!\" an ad for which appears to have aired on Fox News, and also focuses on this tale of Wilkerson\u2019s prophecy. A video posted April 23 on a YouTube account called \"Mike Evans\" shows the ad airing during \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\nAs a photograph of Wilkerson appears on screen, a narrator reads the same prophecy that is quoted in the Facebook post. \"Number one New York Times best-selling author Mike Evans has written an astonishing book on it called \u2018A Great Awakening is Coming!\u2019\" it continues. Then it directs viewers to get the book and the full prophecy by going to a website, where they can purchase the book in print, electronic form or in a set with DVDs selling for up to $56.90.\n\nWilkerson\u2019s claims have faced scrutiny before. In 2009, Snopes.com debunked the claim that he was sent a message from God warning of the terrorist attacks in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nWilkerson had claimed to have been awoken from a dream weeks before planes crashed into the Twin Towers and told by God to prepare sandwiches. He claimed that he and other members of the Times Square Church made over 2,000 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. However, there was no evidence that the sandwiches were actually made prior to the attacks; they were actually made during the day on Sept. 11, after planes had already crashed into the Twin Towers.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post from the Jerusalem Prayer team says Wilkerson warned Evans of a plague striking New York City, shutting down bars and restaurants and forcing people to shelter in their homes.\n\nThere is no evidence that Wilkerson said this, and his own church denies any instance of him saying this in a book or sermon.

Tony Evers\u2019 administration from extending the stay-at-home order into late May.\n\nEvers had issued a \"Safer at Home\" order March 24, 2020, that restricted movement and business activity throughout the state through April 24. On April 16 that order was extended to May 26, 2020, this time signed by Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm.\n\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald made their case for an injunction blocking Palm in a joint statement released the same day as the lawsuit. After referencing \"public outcry\" and condemning Evers for \"unprecedented administrative overreach,\" the three-paragraph statement ends with this:\n\n\"The constant stream of executive orders \u2026 are eroding both the economy and their liberty even as the state is clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the determinations on scope of authority to the courts, but the last bit of that is clearly a data-based claim.\n\nAre infections \"clearly\" on the decline in Wisconsin?\n\nMetrics are largely flat, not declining\n\nAt the time of the joint statement, COVID-19 had resulted in 242 deaths in Wisconsin, with 4,620 people testing positive for the disease.\n\nKit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Vos, said the decline claim was based on hospitalization data and the hospital resource usage estimated in a model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.\n\nThe oft-cited model, last updated April 17, projected Wisconsin\u2019s peak resource usage to be somewhere between April 10 and April 18. It\u2019s an estimate based on their formula, not a firm calculation based on actual figures. The model has drawn some criticism for its methodology, which experts say could make it ill-suited to help determine when to ease social distancing restrictions.\n\nIn any case, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to rely on a predictive model when we have actual data to examine for Wisconsin.\n\nSo we\u2019ll do that, starting with the hospitalization numbers Beyer cited.\n\nRELATED: No proof (yet) of a post-election \"surge\" in Wisconsin coronavirus cases\n\nAs with most datasets, labeling something an upward or downward trend depends entirely on which part of the data you pluck out.

The tally was lower the days before that due to a lower number of tests being performed.\n\nThe most recent tally released prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald was April 20, with 153 cases, up six from the day before.

But Murphy is wrong on the number. He mixed up two numbers from an April 4 New York Times report.\n\nThe New York Times analysis detailed the number of travelers that arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China toward the start of 2020. The analysis relied on flight and other data from the U.S. Commerce Department, American firms MyRadar and FlightAware, and VariFlight, an aviation data company based in China, according to the report.\n\nRELATED: Are COVID-19 travel restrictions \u2018more critical in saving lives\u2019 than testing? Not really\n\nMurphy was referring to a larger number that included travel both before and after Trump\u2019s restrictions kicked in. According to the report, there were at least 430,000 people who flew directly into the U.S. from China between Dec. 31, 2019, when China notified the World Health Organization that it was treating cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown illness, and early April.\n\nThat total included a smaller number of travelers whose direct flights occurred after Trump imposed travel restrictions on China starting Feb. 2 \u2014 and this smaller number is what Murphy should have used when talking about what happened after the restrictions.\n\nAlmost 40,000 \"Americans and other authorized travelers\" entered in the two months after the Trump administration announced the restrictions, the report said. The travel restrictions made exceptions for U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their family members.\n\nThe New York Times report mentioned both numbers in its first paragraph:\n\n\"Since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonialike illness to international health officials on New Year\u2019s Eve, at least 430,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after President Trump imposed restrictions on such travel, according to an analysis of data collected in both countries.\"\n\nMurphy spokesperson Jaime Geller said the senator \"misspoke and meant to say that 400,000+ people traveled to the U.S. from the start of the outbreak, referencing this New York Times reporting.\"\n\nThe report said \"the bulk\" of the passengers arrived in January on more than 1,300 direct flights to the U.S. from China. It said 279 direct flights from China flew in between the time of the report and the start of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions, which have since expanded in several ways.\n\nTravelers check in for an American Airlines flight at Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, on Jan. 30, 2020.

Chinese government data shows that the earliest known case was Nov. 17, per the South China Morning Post.\n\nTravel into the U.S. is currently prohibited for \"certain foreign nationals who have been physically present\" in China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom or 26 other countries in Europe in the previous two weeks, the CBP spokesperson said.\n\nAmerican citizens, legal residents and other exempted individuals can continue to travel into the U.S., the spokesperson said, but they require screening upon arrival and can only come in through one of 13 U.S. airports.\n\nRELATED: Rick Santorum said Trump was \u2018ahead of the curve\u2019 on China travel restrictions.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA screenshot of a viral tweet shared to Facebook that wrongly claimed to show the CDC's COVID-19 survival rates.\n\nThe age-specific \"survival rates\" listed in the post did not come from the CDC, however. CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told PolitiFact that the agency has not released any age-specific COVID-19 survival rates, nor does it have mortality rates available.\n\n\"Survival analysis is highly complex,\" Reed said. \"CDC does not have the data to calculate survivability for COVID-19. Unclear as to where social media users are getting this information.\"\n\n\"We don\u2019t have that data, so we don\u2019t know,\" added Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida. \"And neither would the person who posted (the tweet).\"\n\nSketchy sourcing\n\nThe tweet didn\u2019t cite a specific CDC source for its \"COVID-19 survival rates.\" PolitiFact tried to reach Jimenez through messages to her Conservative Latina Twitter and Facebook accounts, but we did not hear back.\n\nThe figures line up with parameters included as part of CDC planning scenarios designed to help public health agencies model the impact of the pandemic.\n\nIn a September document labeled \"COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios,\" the agency listed five sets of parameters that represented different levels of disease severity and transmissibility, with the goal of helping public health agencies make models to estimate the effects of the virus.\n\nThe infection fatality rates listed under the scenario marked as the \"current best estimate\" correspond with the \"survival rates\" listed in the tweet. But those infection fatality rates, the document says, are based on data through Aug. 8. And there are other caveats.\n\nLead Stories debunked a Facebook post citing the same scenarios to wrongly claim that the CDC had downgraded the severity of COVID-19 to something less than the flu.\n\nThe CDC document says the scenarios \"are not predictions of the expected effects of COVID-19\" and \"do not reflect the impact of any behavioral changes, social distancing, or other interventions.\" It also says \"uncertainty remains around nearly all parameter values.\"\n\nThe tweet also ignored the toll a seemingly small fatality rate can take when a disease spreads unchecked. Johns Hopkins University puts the observed case fatality ratio \u2014 calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases \u2014 at about 1.8% for the U.S. At that rate, if every American got COVID-19, there would be almost 6 million deaths.\n\nDoctors have gotten better at treating the disease since the outbreak of the pandemic, PolitiFact reported. But the numbers of new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported each day in the U.S. have skyrocketed in recent weeks. \"Excess deaths\" remain above historical norms. The risk of severe illness from the coronavirus increases with age, the CDC says.\n\nSurvival rates are hard to estimate\n\nIn a pandemic, it\u2019s difficult to nail down data points like survival rates, Prins told PolitiFact.

This was the ruling of The United States Supreme Court shortly after the \u2018civil war\u2019 in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866) which yet stands to this day: \u2018Neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution in case of emergency \u2026\u2019\n\n\u2026 therefore, ANYONE who declares the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed rights (to freely travel, peacefully assemble, earn a living, freely worship, etc.) and or attempts to enforce such suspension within 50 independent, sovereign, continental United States of America is making war against our constitution(s) and, therefore, we the people. They violate their constitutional oath and, thus, immediately forfeit their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity and that means ANYONE; even the governor and President.\"\n\nThe cited case, Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866), was about disputed judicial authority during the Civil War. In 1864, Lambdin P. Milligan was arrested and tried by a military tribunal in his home state of Indiana and sentenced to death by hanging. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the military courts established by the president during wartime had no judicial power in secure areas with established civil courts, and Milligan was released.\n\nThe case citation and time frame in the post are legitimate. But the quote about government authority does not come from this case.\n\nThat quote, or a close match, comes from a case argued in the Illinois Supreme Court in 1935. In People ex rel. Lyle vs. City of Chicago, the justices of Chicago\u2019s municipal court filed a complaint against the City Council over unpaid salaries amid the Depression. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in their favor and ordered the city to pay them the partial salaries that had been withheld.\n\nIn his opinion, the Illinois chief justice said that \"neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution even in case of a great emergency.\" He was referring to the Illinois Constitution and the Municipal Court of Chicago\u2019s founding laws.\n\nThe second part of this claim that says orders \"can be disregarded with impunity\" doesn\u2019t come from either of these cases and wasn\u2019t found in any court cases or acts.\n\nWe also found ample evidence that states do have the authority to issue stay-at-home orders. According to the American Bar Association, the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 10th Amendment and past U.S. Supreme Court decisions dictate that \"state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that there haven\u2019t been cases brought against governors and local governments in California, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania that are attempting to prove stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. There have been mixed results from local courts, which all base their decisions on state laws and constitutions.\n\nRight now, the Supreme Court refuses to take a side. On May 8, the high court declined to review a case from a group of Pennsylvania businesses\u2019 that wanted to block Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s stay-at-home order.\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has supported state\u2019s rights to deal with public health emergencies. The best example of the Supreme Court supporting a state\u2019s power to impose mandatory restrictions during a pandemic is Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905).\n\nThe case was brought against the Cambridge board of health and its response to a surge in smallpox cases in the city. The city\u2019s board of health issued an order that all adults had to be vaccinated against the disease, or they would face a $5 fine (about $100 today). Henning Jacobson refused to be vaccinated, after having bad reactions to earlier vaccines. When the state of Massachusetts fined him, he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe court ruled in the state\u2019s favor, stating that they had full power to restrict the freedoms of any citizen if it \"is necessarily subject for the common good\" and that they had \"distinctly recognized the authority of a State to enact quarantine laws and \u2018health laws of every description.\u2019\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claims that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded with impunity.\n\nThe claim cites an actual Supreme Court case, but it quotes a judicial opinion from an unrelated state case in Illinois dealing with judges\u2019 salaries. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/05/09", "false_statement": " Under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, stay-at-home orders are illegal in the United States and can be disregarded with impunity.\t\t", "true_statement": " No, that\u2019s not a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

The report spotlighted security problems using Zoom, but it didn\u2019t look at whether China was using the tech platform \"as a way to spy on our citizens.\"\n\n\"If (Kirk) is describing our findings as providing proof that the Chinese government is definitively spying on Zoom meetings, then that is inaccurate,\" said Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab and co-author of the report on Zoom\u2019s encryption.\n\nA spokesperson for Zoom told us the company, which is based in San Jose, California, is not aware of any efforts by China to use its platform for espionage. The FBI and Defense Department declined to comment.\n\nResearchers found security issues with Zoom\n\nIn their report, Marczak and co-author John Scott-Railton examined the encryption scheme protecting meetings hosted on Zoom.\n\nThey found that Zoom \"uses non-industry-standard cryptographic techniques with identifiable weaknesses\" to safeguard its conferences. The app\u2019s encryption keys \u2014 long, random strings of characters used to protect encoded data \u2014 were sometimes routed through servers in China, even when all meeting participants are outside of China.\n\nThey wrote that this flaw is \"potentially concerning, given that Zoom may be legally obligated to disclose these keys to authorities in China,\" where they said the company employs roughly 700 people. The company\u2019s website says it has more than 2,000 employees worldwide.\n\nA spokesperson for Kirk cited these findings, news reports about them and China\u2019s history of surveillance and of spying on U.S. companies as evidence in support of Kirk\u2019s claim.\n\n\"It\u2019s well established that China is engaged in massive amounts of domestic surveillance and has established massive controls on any data that is routed to servers hosted in China \u2014 which is exactly what Zoom has done,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Citizen Lab report did conclude that Zoom is \"not suited for secrets.\" It said governments, businesses concerned about cybercrime and espionage, health care providers, and activists, lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics should all be especially careful.\n\nBut Kirk\u2019s tweet missed another conclusion that Zoom users may find reassuring.\n\n\"For those using Zoom to keep in touch with friends, hold social events, or organize courses or lectures that they might otherwise hold in a public or semi-public venue, our findings should not necessarily be concerning,\" Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote.\n\nZoom is working to patch up security issues\n\nThe Citizen Lab\u2019s findings amplified concerns that have dogged Zoom as it has gained popularity.\n\nOnline trolls have learned to invade meetings and project graphic material using Zoom's screen-sharing feature, for example. The practice, known as \"Zoombombing,\" has led some school districts, including in New York City, to ban the platform for online learning.\n\nZoom has since pledged to beef up its security. In a response to the Citizen Lab\u2019s report, CEO Eric Yuan said the routing of encryption keys through China was a \"misstep\" that resulted from Zoom\u2019s \"urgency to come to the aid of people around the world\" as the coronavirus spread.\n\nThe routing problem has since been corrected, Yuan said, adding that it was never an issue for the separate version of Zoom available to government customers.\n\nThe company has also clarified its encryption practices, and Yuan said in another blog post that Zoom has paused extra features for 90 days so its engineers can focus on security fixes.\n\n\"Zoom has robust cybersecurity protection and a number of layered safeguards and built-in protections to help prevent unwanted meeting access,\" a company spokesperson told us.\n\nJames Andrew Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said concerns about Zoom strike him as \"overstated.\"\n\n\"Zoom has development offices in China,\" he said. \"But its backroom functions are performed by an American cloud service provider using a very secure service located here in the U.S.\"\n\nMore people working from home is a \"goldmine for intel agencies\" that China will likely exploit, he said, but other technology companies may also face similar threats. The FBI recently issued a warning about cyber attacks that could come from the increased use of videoconferencing.\n\nKirk overstated the Citizen Lab\u2019s findings on China\n\nMarczak and Scott-Railton wrote that the problems they identified make Zoom \"a clear target to reasonably well-resourced nation state attackers,\" including China.\n\nBut they never said China is spying on American citizens through Zoom, as Kirk claimed.\n\n\"We found that the Chinese government could conduct this sort of surveillance, but our methodology cannot produce a finding one way or the other about whether this surveillance is actually occurring,\" Marczak told PolitiFact.\n\nHe said their goal was to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited, not to catch bad actors.\n\n\"China is capable of conducting this kind of surveillance,\" he said. \"The question is whether they are actually doing it. If they are doing it, ordinary people are unlikely to be targets.\"\n\nOther cybersecurity experts agreed that China would not likely target the average American.\n\n\"I would suspect that if Chinese intel agencies are taking advantage of Zoom vulnerabilities, and I assume they are, they are targeting government users and business users,\" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn past Chinese hacks involving information on ordinary American citizens \u2014 including attacks on Marriott and Equifax \u2014 the hackers were after big data sets that could be used to spot patterns in people who might be willing to spy on China\u2019s behalf, Segal said.\n\n\"You might be able to pull those things out of Zoom calls, but it would take much more work and be less reliable,\" he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely that China would be monitoring every U.S.-based Zoom call because of the money and manpower needed to do so, experts told us.\n\n\"In practice, the cost to do this should be high enough that China wouldn't want to use this as a mass surveillance tool, but rather a tool for targeted surveillance,\" Marczak said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nKirk said, \"The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.\"\n\nThe claim is based on a report from researchers at the University of Toronto. But one of the researchers told us that while they identified security issues with Zoom, whether China has exploited the platform for espionage was not something they considered.\n\nChina is likely capable of using Zoom for spying, experts told us. It\u2019s not implausible that the country has tried using it to target governments, businesses and others with sensitive information.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether China has done so. But there\u2019s no proof that it has.

In a FAQ about the 2019 coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed his confusion head-on.\n\n\"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified,\" the CDC wrote. \"The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not that same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\"\n\nThe 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain of coronavirus\n\nThe current strain of coronavirus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. It\u2019s one of seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the CDC.\n\nNamed for the crown-like spikes on their surface, coronaviruses are typically found in animals such as camels, cattle and bats. Strains infecting humans were discovered in the mid 1960s.\n\nRELATED: PolitiFact\u2019s coronavirus coverage in one place\n\nMost strains that affect humans are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a \"beta coronavirus\" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012.\n\nAll three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath \u2014 similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nA CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains \"usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.\"\n\nBut the same fact-sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. \"This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,\" it said.\n\nWhat Limbaugh got wrong\n\nLimbaugh seems to have been \"mixing up clinical symptoms as defining the disease,\" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n\"Many diseases start off with \u2018flu-like symptoms\u2019 and progress on to something else,\" Watanabe said, noting that the 2019 coronavirus is part of a different family of viruses than the flu.\n\nRELATED: A reader\u2019s guide to misinformation about the coronavirus\n\nNeurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air that Limbaugh\u2019s comparison was \"minimizing\" what the 2019 coronavirus could become.\n\n\"This is a brand new virus,\" he said. \"I think what Rush Limbaugh is referring to is the idea that it is from a family of coronaviruses. That is the family name of these viruses, and some of them in the past have caused systems that were more consistent with the common cold. But it\u2019s also been the same family of viruses that caused SARS, that caused MERS.\"\n\nExperts from the National Institutes of Health and Penn State University\u2019s College of Medicine drew a line from the spread of the 2019 virus to outbreaks of SARS and MERS in a report titled \"Coronavirus Infections \u2014 More Than Just the Common Cold.\"\n\nAccording to the WHO, about 80% of 2019 coronavirus patients have recovered from mild symptoms without needing special treatment, while roughly 1 in every 6 people have become \"seriously ill.\" About 2% of people have died. (For comparison, the flu \u2014 which is more severe than the common cold \u2014 has an estimated death rate in the United States of about 0.1%).\n\nPeople who are older or have certain pre-existing health conditions have been more likely to experience serious symptoms, the WHO\u2019s website says.\n\n\"There are alpha coronaviruses that cause common cold,\" said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. \"This is a beta coronavirus like SARS and MERS and is approximately 20 to 30 times more deadly than (the) flu.\"\n\nWe follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions.

Tony Evers to reopen the state, the lack of an American flag at their chosen location became a point of contention.\n\nThe Associated Press reported chants of \"Where\u2019s our flag?\" and protesters calling it a \"disgrace.\"\n\nA similar claim surfaced in a viral Facebook post on June 12, 2020.\n\n\"Wisconsin Democrat Governor Evers removed the American flag from the Capitol building by ordering it to be taken down! This is beyond disgraceful!\" the post said.\n\nThe text accompanied an undated photo showing protesters outside the Capitol building, with an empty flagpole circled in red.\n\nThis question is particularly notable since in the intervening time, Evers has ordered the Capitol fly the rainbow pride flag for Pride Month (as he did in 2019) and the Juneteenth flag to commemorate the end of slavery.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\n\nSo did Evers really order the American flag removed at some point?\n\nAnswering that means figuring out where and when this picture was taken. Let\u2019s get to sleuthing.\n\nTracking down the setting\n\nThe Wisconsin Capitol building in Madison \u2014 completed in 1917 \u2014 is a symmetrical structure with a similar fa\u00e7ade of pillars and windows facing north, south, east and west. The peak of each entry has a flagpole.\n\nSo the first question is which flagpole we\u2019re talking about.\n\nA review of photos from Google Maps shows the picture in question was taken at the West (State Street) entrance. That entrance has two rows of windows, with arched windows at the top. The other three entrances each have three rows, with a smaller row atop the arched windows.\n\nThe west wing of the Capitol houses the state Assembly, so that body is in charge of which flag flies when. The Assembly policy \u2014 like the state Senate \u2014 is to fly the American flag, but only when the body is in session.\n\nThe other element is when this photo was taken, since it\u2019s undated in the Facebook post.\n\nThe most notable recent rally there occurred April 24, 2020, when protesters gathered to pressure Evers into reopening the state amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lone readable sign in the image \u2014 SCIENCE says \"OPEN WISCONSIN!\" \u2014 gives us the key clue here.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly consistent with a reopen rally. But more importantly, that same sign can be seen in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel photo of the event.\n\nPutting it together\n\nSo we have a picture from April 24 on the west wing of the Capitol.\n\nThat\u2019s the Assembly flagpole, and since the Assembly wasn\u2019t in session that day (having adjourned the day before), not flying the American flag was standard operating procedure.\n\nThe protesters could have seen the American flag in its usual spot alongside the Wisconsin flag if they had walked around to the east side of the Capitol.\n\nThe governor has authority over that flagpole and the north wing pole that flies the POW-MIA flag. The state Senate controls the remaining south wing flagpole.\n\nSo the Facebook post in question is not only wrong that Evers had authority over the flagpole in question, it goes a step further by claiming the U.S. flag was absent because of a specific order from the governor.\n\nBritt Cudabeck, a spokeswoman for Evers, confirmed the governor did not order any U.S. flag taken down. The U.S. and Wisconsin flags have flown daily on the east pole as usual.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claims Evers ordered the U.S. flag removed from the state Capitol, posting as support a picture of an empty flagpole.\n\nOur research shows that photo was taken seven weeks before the Facebook post in front of the west wing of the Capitol, which is controlled by the state Assembly. The flag only flies when the Assembly is in session, and it wasn\u2019t that day.\n\nSo the post is not only wrong, it moves into the realm of the ridiculous by manufacturing the assertion that Evers had specifically ordered the flag removed.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/06/12", "false_statement": " Gov. of Wisconsin Tony Evers \u201cremoved the American flag from the Capitol building\u201d.\t\t", "true_statement": " The picture presented as proof was from a rally in support of reopening Wisconsin on April 24, 2020.

I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.\u201d\n\n\u2022 When journalist Yamiche Alcindor asked a question of President Donald Trump, she was accurately citing a previous comment Trump had made on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show.\n\nPresident Donald Trump argued with \"PBS NewsHour\" reporter Yamiche Alcindor over what the president had said, or hadn\u2019t said, about New York\u2019s need for ventilators.\n\nVentilators are a type of medical equipment considered vital for saving the lives of patients hit hardest by the virus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made urgent calls for more ventilators to cope with a rising number of hospitalizations in his state due to coronavirus.\n\n\"All the predictions say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators,\" Cuomo told reporters March 27, citing estimates by Weill Cornell Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and McKinsey & Co.\n\nAnthony Fauci, a leading infectious-disease specialist who is on the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, told CNN, \"There are a lot of different calculations. My experience, I tend to believe Gov. Cuomo.\"\n\nThe exchange between Trump and Alcindor came during a March 29 Rose Garden press conference. It unfolded this way:\n\nAlcindor: \"You've said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. You said New York might need \u2014\"\n\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t say that.\"\n\nAlcindor: \"\u2014 might not need 30,000.\"\n\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t say that.\"\n\nAlcindor: \"You said it on Sean Hannity\u2019s, Fox News.\"\n\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t say \u2014 come on. Come on.\"\n\nThe exchange continued, with Trump at one point telling Alcindor, \"Be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening.\" He later cut her off before she was able to ask her second question, although another reporter subsequently handed her the microphone so that she could ask it.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll look at the substance of the dispute between Trump and Alcindor. Which of them was right about what he said during a March 26 phone interview on Hannity\u2019s show on Fox News?\n\nAlcindor was.\n\nWhen we looked at Trump\u2019s interview with Hannity, we found two portions in which Trump addressed this question.\n\nHere\u2019s the first:\n\n\"Gov. Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them (ventilators). 30,000! All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers.\"\n\nLater, Hannity picked up on this theme. Hannity said he was \"kind of angry at Andrew Cuomo. I had a great \u2014 I had him on radio for 40 minutes, great conversation. I grew up in \u2014 I was born and raised in New York. And then it's, \u2018I need 30,000 ventilators.\u2019 And I'm like OK, it really \u2014 it was annoying me.\"\n\nTrump subsequently echoed this sentiment.\n\n\"New York is a bigger deal. But it's going to go also. But I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?\"\n\nSo, contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated denials during the press conference, this passage clearly shows that the president told Hannity that he feels the numbers of ventilators being requested by governors, including Cuomo, are higher than what\u2019s needed.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump told Alcindor that \"I didn\u2019t say that\" some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need.\n\nThat\u2019s directly refuted by Trump\u2019s comments during Hannity\u2019s show, in which he said, \"I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be.

This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity\u2014for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing\u2014even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\"\n\nOSHA recommends masks\n\nThe article we\u2019re checking is on a website called GreenMedInfo. The article doesn\u2019t have text per se, but rather two videos and links to OSHA web pages.\n\nBut we found that on its website, OSHA repeatedly recommends the use of face coverings:\n\nFrom OSHA\u2019s \"COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions\":\n\nCloth face coverings are worn in public over the nose and mouth \"to contain the wearer's potentially infectious respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and to limit the spread\" of the coronavirus.\n\nFrom OSHA\u2019s \"Guidance on Returning to Work\":\n\nEmployers must determine PPE (personal protective equipment) such as gloves, surgical masks and face shields) are necessary for employees.\n\nFrom OSHA\u2019s \"Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19\":\n\n\"Provide a face mask, if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if tolerated. ...Most workers at high or very high exposure risk likely need to wear gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and either a face mask or a respirator, depending on their job tasks and exposure risks.\"\n\nOSHA\u2019s response to the post\n\nA Department of Labor spokeswoman told PolitiFact that OSHA \"generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work.

I wonder why. https://t.co/HOX2Tc5PWt \u2014 Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) April 6, 2020\n\nAn exaggerated death count is a persistent talking point. On April 4, Owens tweeted \"State departments of Public Health are reporting the number of deaths BEFORE the medical examiners have even concluded the cause of death,\" she said. \"There would be no legitimate way to report how many people die daily.\"\n\nAre Owens\u2019 claims correct? We asked her for evidence but did not hear back. What we found is that her statement is at odds with doctors, who say the data, in fact, reflects an undercount.\n\nHere\u2019s why the details of death reporting back up the doctors more than the pundits.\n\nComplicating factors aren\u2019t so complicated\n\nOwens is wrong that only medical examiners determine a person\u2019s cause of death. Formal death certificates start with the attending doctor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells physicians to list the immediate cause of death, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, and then proceed to the underlying disease that caused the heart or breathing to stop.\n\nThe underlying cause should be \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.\"\n\nIf a person showed up in the emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms and a heart attack, there could be a judgement call as to what goes in as the underlying cause. But Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there would be strong argument to note the key role of COVID-19.\n\n\"I would put COVID-19 as the primary cause,\" Plescia said. \"Because most likely, the heart attack was caused by the fever or a difficulty in breathing.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the virus lands harder on people with pre-existing heart and lung problems.\n\n\"If those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory,\" said Dr. Sally Aiken, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.\n\nAiken added, \"it is not a conspiracy, or any different than what occurs during non-COVID-19 times.\"\n\nThe CDC said in a statement that if it works with death certificate data, it will add a death to the COVID-19 tally regardless on which line the disease is listed.\n\nDeath certificates and COVID-19 reports are different\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that death certificates are not the only \u2014 or even primary way \u2014 the states report coronavirus deaths.\n\nNew York, which to date accounts for over 40% of deaths nationwide, does not use death certificate data for reporting COVID-19 fatalities. When a person with the virus dies, hospitals or nursing homes tell their local health officials who then notify the state health department, which in turn sends a report to Washington.\n\nProviders in New York use this form to record the death, and unlike a full death certificate, it provides just one place to note the disease.\n\nThis quick reporting form lacks the details that go into a death certificate. Like seasonal flu, COVID-19 is what is known as a nationally notifiable disease. Heart attacks and strokes fall into the larger group of diseases that are not tracked in real time. The system to gather COVID-19 data is designed to help public health officials track what is happening as quickly as possible.\n\nDeath certificates are processed at a slower pace.\n\nWhy doctors say we\u2019re likely undercounting, not overcounting deaths\n\nThere are several reasons COVID-19 victims might not make it into the quick reporting system.\n\n\"Doctors won't record a death until they are certain,\" Plescia said. \"And with the high volume of cases, they may not be reporting because they move on to other things.\"\n\nPlescia added that if a person dies on the way to the hospital, or very soon after, they won\u2019t be tested for the virus.\n\n\"There\u2019s nothing any more you can do for them,\" he said.\n\nAiken said if the person had no symptoms of the coronavirus, her department wouldn\u2019t test them.\n\n\"These decedents are not being tested for COVID-19 as a matter of course,\" Aiken said.\n\nGiven the scarcity of tests, Aiken said, that\u2019s generally true across the country.\n\nPlescia said, \"if there\u2019s any error, it\u2019s in under-reporting.\"\n\nAiken echoed the point, and said it applies to death certificates as well.\n\n\"COVID-19 deaths will likely be under-reported on death certificates and not over-reported,\" Aiken said. \"This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nOwens said that \"everyone is dying of coronavirus now.\" Her post reflects a misunderstanding of how COVID-19 interacts with other health conditions and how deaths are reported.\n\nThe physicians we reached said it\u2019s important to track when COVID-19 triggers a pre-existing heart or lung condition. To meet the need for immediate data, New York sends the CDC summaries of COVID-19 deaths, and not the full death certificates.\n\nPeople familiar with the tracking system say some victims go uncounted. They told us that the limited supply of testing, the pace of work at hospitals and deaths that take place outside any medical facility point to an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths, not an overreporting.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "date": "2020/04/06", "false_statement": " \u201cEveryone is only dying of coronavirus now.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Patients who test positive for the coronavirus are likely being included in nationwide death counts.

The weekly provisional deaths table doesn\u2019t begin until the week ending Feb. 1, 2020. What\u2019s more, these numbers are continuously updated due to reporting lags, which the CDC says can range from one week to eight weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nThe provisional tally for the year, as of Dec. 11, has already gone up to 2,728,104.\n\nMeanwhile, in another report, the CDC estimated that COVID-19 has caused almost 200,000 excess deaths in the U.S. from late January through early October. Excess deaths are defined in the report as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time.\n\n\"Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19,\" the agency reported.\n\nLauren Rossen, a data scientist with CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that the numbers of deaths in 2020 are \"without a question NOT on par with previous years\" and that claims that the numbers are equivalent are based on misinterpretations and misuse of the available data.\n\nSince we don\u2019t have all the data for 2020, Rossen said a more accurate analysis would need to involve comparing the number of deaths that occurred in the first 44 weeks, or so, of the year with the number of deaths that occurred over those same weeks in previous years.\n\n\"Looking at the number of deaths each year through week 44 (the most recent weeks are incomplete in 2020 due to the length of time it takes to receive and tabulate death certificates), we can see the totals over the same time periods each year.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, said China has been the source of multiple recent contagions breaking out because of what he called a culture of eating some animals such as bats, snakes and dogs.\n\nIn remarks captured by The Hill, Cornyn said this applies to the new coronavirus.\n\n\"China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the swine flu and now the coronavirus,\" he said. \"I think they have a fundamental problem and I don't object to geographically identifying where it is coming from.\"\n\nHe made a similar comment on a weekly conference call with reporters in Texas, stating that the \"open meat markets that serve everything from bats to tapirs to snake to dog meat\" allow viruses to jump from animals to humans.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s video clip of Cornyn\u2019s remark was shared thousands of times on social media, so we\u2019ll focus on fact-checking that statement, keeping the context of his second claim in mind.\n\nCornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie said Cornyn\u2019s statement is referring to the culture behind so-called wet markets in China.\n\n\"If people didn\u2019t eat that type of meat, wet markets would not exist,\" he said in an interview, referencing the animals Cornyn identified in his remarks.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nSARS, MERS and Swine Flu\n\nBefore we address the parts of Cornyn\u2019s claim related to the coronavirus, let\u2019s take a look at his assertion that the viruses SARS, MERS and swine flu originated in China.\n\nCornyn is right about SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was first reported in 2003 in the Guangdong province of southern China, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSARS is thought to be an animal virus, but its source remains uncertain. It is believed to have spread from the source animal to other animals and infected humans, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nBut Cornyn is wrong about where the first MERS and swine flu cases were reported. Brandewie said Cornyn misspoke when included them in his list.\n\nMERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the CDC.\n\nSwine flu, or the H1N1 flu, was first identified in humans in the United States in 2009, according to the CDC.\n\nTransmission of the virus\n\nThe first part of Cornyn\u2019s claim states that people in China \"eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.\"\n\nBut Peter Li, associate professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston, said this type of cuisine is not representative of Chinese culture.\n\n\"Chinese as a whole do not have wildlife eating habit,\" Li said in an email. \"It is the eating habit of a small number of people, just like a small number of people in the U.S. dare to eat rattlesnakes or the like. \u2026 The eating habit is not Chinese and not traditional.\"\n\nEven considering the small population that may consume these animals, Adam Kamradt-Scott, an associate professor of global health security at the University of Sydney in Australia, said \"The consumption of exotic meats is not, in itself, the problem.\"\n\n\"The issue is instead the level and extent of the human-animal interface that wet markets permit,\" he said in an email. \"Having said this, we have yet to identify the host animal for the COVID-19 virus. \u2026 It has also not been verified whether the COVID-19 virus infected humans at the wet market in Wuhan, only that some of the first cases to be identified had a history of having visited the wet market.\"\n\nThe CDC\u2019s situation page for the new virus states that early cases in China \"had some link\" to the market, as did numerous news articles highlighted by Brandewie in response to PolitiFact\u2019s inquiry.\n\nBut researchers have yet to pinpoint when, where or how the virus was transmitted from animals to humans.\n\n\"It was originally suggested that it began at the Wuhan fish market, but there is no longer good evidence to support that,\" said Vincent Racaniello, a virology professor in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at Columbia University who is researching the virus. \"The first case was not associated with that market and now we think there were earlier clusters in November not associated with the market.\"\n\nRacaniello pointed to a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of January by researchers in China looking at the first 425 confirmed cases of the virus.\n\nThe data shows that while the first reported cases of the new virus were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, the first identified case of the virus predated the publicly reported cases and was found in a person with no connection to the market.\n\nOther researchers also identified early cases unrelated to the market.\n\nIn the March 15 episode of his virology podcast, This Week in Virology, Racaniello interviewed coronavirus researcher Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill about the origins of the current pandemic.\n\nBaric said researchers have identified numerous SARS-like strains in bats and said it is \"just a question of time for when a human comes in contact with a bat\" carrying these viruses and that sparks a new pandemic.\n\nHe added that it is entirely possible that the current outbreak was caused by a person in rural China who came into contact with a bat or bat guano and then traveled to Wuhan and started the outbreak.\n\nBaric said the initial contact could have occurred in a farmer harvesting bat guano to use as fertilizer or \"just by random chance\" in a person who came into contact with bat guano when a bat flew overhead and its droppings fell.\n\nNot strictly cultural\n\nIt\u2019s true that markets that sell live animals that are slaughtered on the premises pose a risk or viruses to be transmitted from animals to humans, but experts said this risk exists across the globe and is not unique to China.\n\n\"His claim, if it were true, is ridiculous,\" said Li, the University of Houston professor. \"No country in the world monopolizes the outbreaks of epidemics.\"\n\nRacaniello said that suggesting the new coronavirus is \"spread simply by eating a bat is too simplistic,\" as is pointing only to China as the source of new viruses.\n\n\"If you eliminated all eating of bats, you would still have these spillovers,\" he said. \"The four mild coronaviruses we have probably crossed from bats into humans hundreds of years ago \u2014 that could have happened anywhere. This is much broader than eating a bat in a meat market. I think that\u2019s the important key here, that there are a lot of ways for viruses to get from various animals into humans.\"\n\nPeter Daszak, a disease ecologist and president of the research organization EcoHealth Alliance, said global health experts discussed the potential of a new pandemic in 2018 (labeling it \"Disease X\"), as pandemics are on the rise and the world\u2019s strategy for dealing with these illnesses is \"woefully inadequate,\" in op-ed for the New York Times.\n\nDaszak wrote:\n\n\"These spillovers are increasing exponentially as our ecological footprint brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us supremely susceptible to pathogens like coronaviruses.\"\n\nScience writer David Quammen discussed future risk during an interview on NPR\u2019s Fresh Air in February, and said the reason the globe is seeing more viruses in humans is because we \"are so abundant and so disruptive on this planet that we come in contact with these things.\"\n\nHe continued:\n\n\"There's 7.7 billion of us. We're cutting the tropical forests. We're building work camps in those forests and villages. We're eating the wildlife. We're transporting wildlife around the world. We're raising a lot of domestic livestock that become exposed to viruses through wildlife.\n\n\"We're doing all these forms of disruption that I say sometimes that you go into a forest and you shake the trees, literally and figuratively, and viruses fall out. And if they fall out of their hosts, they need a new host. And we're there. We're available. We're their opportunity. And then we fly around the world and carry it every which way.\"\n\nOur Ruling\n\nCornyn said: \"China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu and now the coronavirus.\"\n\nFirst of all, Cornyn is wrong that MERS and the Swine Flu were first identified in humans in China. He is right that SARS and the new coronavirus were first identified in humans there.\n\nThe problem with Cornyn\u2019s claim is his assertion that Chinese culture is at fault. Experts said the threat of viral transmission from animal to human is not unique to China, and the risk of this kind of spillover is growing globally as humans come into closer contact with animals.\n\nPlus, experts noted that any consumption of the animals Cornyn mentioned is not, in itself, the problem.\n\nIt is also worth noting that researchers have not pinpointed exactly when, where or how the coronavirus hopped from animals to humans. While early reports indicated that the virus jumped from animals to humans at a seafood market in Wuhan, further study has identified cases predating those in people with no connection to the market.\n\nTaken as a whole, Cornyn\u2019s statement is not accurate.

Only a handful of countries have had more deaths per capita.\n\nRELATED: Trump\u2019s comparison of COVID-19 deaths in Germany, US is wrong\n\nThe numbers\n\nA CNBC spokesperson cited data from Johns Hopkins University tracking deaths per 100,000 people, a metric that public health experts generally consider useful.\n\nAs of May 26, the day before Kernen\u2019s claim, the U.S. had recorded 30.23 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nThat was better than 10 countries. It was worse than more than 130 others, including many nations of similar size.\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. had more deaths per 100,000 people at the time of Kernen\u2019s comment than all but a handful of European countries: San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nOnly San Marino (pop. 34,000), Belgium (pop. 11.6 million) and Andorra (pop. 77,000) had more than 60 deaths per 100,000 people. Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy had over 50 deaths per 100,000.\n\nThose figures have hardly changed as of May 27. The U.S. is at 30.69 deaths per 100,000 people, behind the same 10 European nations but ahead of the rest.\n\nThree other sources public health experts told us are reliable \u2014 the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer \u2014 show similar numbers.\n\nEach source shows the U.S. performing worse than the vast majority of countries.\n\n\"We have a very high death rate here compared to most countries in the world, and some of our states have among the highest death rates in the world,\" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University.\n\nThe U.S., in particular, is \"a patchwork epidemic\" because of its \"expansive, diverse geography and populations,\" Nichols said.\n\nDifferent geographic areas experience varying outbreaks and death tolls due to a number of factors, such as the age of the population, how far along the epidemic curve the area is and how well the local health care systems have been able to manage, she said.\n\nIf you compare individual U.S. states to other countries, Nichols said, the situation looks worse. Eleven states plus Washington, D.C have more deaths per million people than the U.S. as a whole, according to Worldometer data for May 28.\n\nSome states are comparable to the worst countries.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, another way to compare countries is to consider recent \u2014 rather than total \u2014 death counts per capita. But as of May 28, numerous countries have also had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than the U.S., per Our World in Data.\n\nOur ruling\n\nKernen said: \"We\u2019re down near the low end of per capita deaths \u2026 Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000.

It's just strange, because they're saying it's because it's easy to travel among these countries. But they're separate from the U.K.,\" Pelosi said. \"Well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K. Again, it's a decision they made. It has its ramifications. We'll see whether it's worth the trouble.\"\n\nPelosi said she wasn\u2019t there to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s decisions, but emphasized that testing would be \"the only way\" to learn how the virus is spreading.\n\nPolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at Pelosi\u2019s comments about travel in Europe and how it relates to the details in Trump\u2019s proclamation.\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban\n\nTrump\u2019s proclamation seeks to restrict \"all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.\"\n\nU.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their close relatives are exempt from the ban. So are numerous categories of other people.\n\nThe Schengen Area covers European states that agree to free movement among their nations without border checks. Countries in the zone include Austria, Belgium, and France (here\u2019s the full list). The United Kingdom \u2014 England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 is not part of the Schengen Area. (Neither is the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union that borders Northern Ireland.)\n\nWhen Pelosi said \"well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K,,\" she was referring to the Channel Tunnel (Chunnel is the short name) that runs under the English Channel linking England and France. People move from one country to the other via trains.\n\nHowever, even if someone gets from France to the United Kingdom, they can\u2019t get on a plane right away and come to the United States, since Trump\u2019s proclamation bars people who had been in Schengen Area two weeks before.\n\nPeople from the United Kingdom who traveled to a Schengen Area state in the two weeks before their attempted travel to the United States would presumably be barred entry, unless they qualify for the exemptions.\n\nPelosi didn\u2019t say that a person could cross the Chunnel and then immediately travel from the United Kingdom to the United States, said Henry V. Connelly, Pelosi\u2019s deputy communications director.\n\n\"The point is that, with the ease of travel between the U.K. and the continent, there\u2019s not a meaningful difference in risk of the community spread of coronavirus between the two \u2014 and thus, not much difference in the coronavirus risk from a person from the U.K. or from inside Schengen Area,\" Connelly said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSpeaking of Trump\u2019s Europe travel restriction exempting the United Kingdom, Pelosi said, \"Well you can just get into the Chunnel, and you\u2019ll be in the U.K.\"\n\nIt isn't that easy to get around the restrictions by taking a train linking England and France. The travel ban applies to people who were in the Schengen Area 14 days before their attempted travel to the United States. So someone in France who traveled to England would not be immediately exempt from the restrictions.\n\nPelosi\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

But his claim that other children are totally safe is incorrect, according to a study published recently in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nTurzai declined to provide any evidence he relied on when he made this claim.\n\nTestifying before the Senate this week, Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease doctor, warned Americans not to be \"cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"\n\nThe study followed 48 children and young adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the U.S. and Canada in March and April. Roughly one out of every five children studied had no underlying conditions. The others suffered from immune suppression, obesity, diabetes, seizures, or chronic lung disease.\n\nIn some cases, the impact of the virus was devastating.\n\nThe Rutgers University researchers who authored the study found that more than 20% of children experienced failure of two or more organ systems and almost 40% required a breathing tube and ventilator. At the end of the study period, a third of the children the researchers tracked were still hospitalized. Two of the children had died.\n\n\"Children without chronic illness are also at risk,\" the study authors wrote. \"Parents need to continue to take the virus seriously.\"\n\nPublication of the study came the same day New York City officials announced that a growing cluster of children sickened with the coronavirus have developed a serious condition called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome.\n\nSo far, at least 52 children have been diagnosed with the syndrome, which causes high fever and swelling and may cause heart and kidney failure.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter Tuesday to challenge the latest coronavirus guidance as vaccines were being distributed around the country.\n\nCruz responded specifically to Dr. Vin Gupta, a lung and intensive care unit doctor who appeared on MSNBC to caution vaccine recipients against abandoning the kinds of preventative measures public health experts have been emphasizing all year.\n\n\"This is one of the misperceptions here: just because you get vaccinated with a second dose, it does not mean you should be participating in things like traveling in the middle of an out-of-control pandemic or that you\u2019re liberated from masks,\" Gupta told MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. \"Everything still applies until all of us get the two-dose regimen, and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen until June or July.\"\n\nMany unknowns surround the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. For instance, it\u2019s unclear if vaccinations strictly protect infected people from serious illness, or if they also prevent people from getting infected, Gupta said.\n\n\"Don\u2019t let your guard down just because you got vaccinated,\" he said. \"You might be able to get infected by the virus and pass it on to others.\"\n\nThe comment was enough to peeve Cruz, who has previously criticized guidance to wear masks and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"This is a bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult,\" Cruz said in a tweet responsive to Gupta\u2019s mask-wearing advice. \"It\u2019s not about vaccines or protecting people\u2019s lives \u2014 it is instead profoundly anti-science, and is only focused on absolute govt control of every aspect of our lives.\"\n\nIn July, Cruz faced criticism after he was photographed maskless on an American Airlines flight one month after the airline required passengers to wear face masks while onboard planes.\n\nCruz stirred controversy again when he called Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, \"a complete ass\" for asking a fellow senator to wear a mask while speaking. And in November, as Texas public health officials urged people to avoid large holiday gatherings as daily case numbers reached record highs, Cruz tweeted a graphic with the words \"Come and take it\" beneath a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nSo is the latest round of COVID-19 guidance \u2014 urging continued mask-wearing and discouraging travel \u2014 \"profoundly anti-science\" as Cruz claims?\n\n\"I think [Cruz] is talking beyond his knowledge,\" said Dr. Jaquelin Dudley, professor of molecular biosciences and associate director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas.\n\n\"This whole thing about mask-wearing, taking a vaccine and social distancing has somehow become a political football instead of, let's just talk about what we know and what we don't know,\" she said.\n\nScience-based guidance\n\nCruz\u2019s office did not respond to a request for clarification on precisely what the senator meant by \"anti-science.\" And a spokesperson for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the organization for which Gupta works, declined to address Cruz\u2019s comments in an effort to remain apolitical. (\"With the issue at hand \u2014 responding to comments by a U.S. senator stating that protective measures against COVID-19 constitute \"bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult\" \u2014 it would be impossible to make this apolitical,\" a spokesperson said.)\n\nBut the guidance highlighted by Gupta is the same messaging that has come from the very top level of the U.S. coronavirus response apparatus. On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Donald Trump\u2019s top adviser on the coronavirus crisis, spoke before an online audience and gave the same cautionary advice.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to be like turning a light switch on and off. It\u2019s not going to be overnight. It\u2019s going to be gradual. ... I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to be able to throw the masks away and forget about physical separation and congregant settings for a while, probably likely until we get into the late fall and early next winter, but I think we can do it,\" he said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advises that there is not enough information \"to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others,\" suggesting that more time is needed for experts to understand how the virus will respond to vaccinated persons.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jonathan Temte of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, the clinical trials of the vaccine have only looked at how the vaccine prevents illness. Those trials didn\u2019t provide any information on transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could still carry and spread the virus.\n\nIt takes repeat exposures for the immune system to learn how to best fight off a virus, which is why COVID-19 vaccinations require two doses about three weeks apart, according to the CDC. Clinical trials through the National Institutes of Health tell us that the immune system begins to create a beta version of antibodies after a person receives the first dose of the vaccine. These are the body\u2019s least optimal version of these antibodies. Phase III trials \u2014 which test for vaccine efficacy \u2014 indicate these initial antibodies are capable of fighting off severe illness caused by the virus, but may be less capable of preventing the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nA second dose of the vaccine helps the body create a new version of antibodies more honed in on fighting COVID-19. A person\u2019s immune system is most capable of fighting off COVID-19 about one month after the initial dose of vaccine.\n\n\"Your body learns. You can\u2019t assume that on day one after the vaccine you\u2019re going to be protected and you\u2019re not going to be able to spread the infection,\" Dudley said.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have that data yet. There\u2019s been so many things to learn,\" she said.\n\nThis is one of the primary sources of uncertainty surrounding the vaccine: whether vaccinated people can be contagious. If vaccinations protect only against illness and not transmissions, achieving herd immunity through vaccination becomes more difficult, according to the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet.\n\n\"Pfizer and Moderna together project that there will be enough vaccines for 35 million individuals in 2020, and perhaps up to 1 billion in 2021,\" The Lancet wrote. \"As a result, many millions of people at high risk of disease will not be immunized any time soon, necessitating the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions.\"\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s also unknown how long immunity will last in a vaccinated person, or how effective vaccination will be in older people or those with underlying comorbidities.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe guidance issued by the CDC that urges vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and avoid travel was described by Cruz as \"profoundly anti-science.\"\n\nThe emerging vaccines each were placed through months of clinical trials that tested for their efficacy in preventing illness. Their efficacy in preventing transmission was not part of the trials and is not yet known. The guidance issued by the public health community is borne out of science\u2019s blind spots in regard to transmission and the gradual pace of vaccine distribution.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/12/15", "false_statement": " U.S. Sen.

That\u2019s not the case.\n\nU.S. citizens are ineligible for a stimulus check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

If the couple filed their taxes separately, then whoever filed using a Social Security number is eligible for the check.\n\nITINs are issued by the IRS for tax purposes, so that foreign nationals and other individuals who don\u2019t have a Social Security number can use it to pay income taxes. Some immigrants in the country illegally pay taxes using an ITIN.\n\nAbout 1.8 million spouses who are either U.S. citizens or green-card holders will be excluded from the stimulus payments, according to estimates from the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post said, \"Trump and McConnell are blocking stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants.\"\n\nThe post wrongly makes it seem as if the law providing the stimulus payment was a doing only of Republicans.

In the time since, Clarke has also lost posts at a pro-President Trump super PAC and as a regular contributor on Fox News.\n\nNow he\u2019s using his free time to make the case everyone is being unreasonable because this is just \"the damn flu.\"\n\nLet\u2019s break it down.\n\nHow they\u2019re the same\n\nCoronavirus and the flu are both viruses, and experts say they have some shared characteristics:\n\nRisk factors \u2014 The groups of people at highest risk are similar, including the elderly.\n\nSpread \u2014 Both diseases spread from person to person through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes (though it\u2019s possible coronavirus lingers in the air longer after the sick person has left).\n\nPrevention \u2014 The expert advice is similar: wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face, stay away from people who are sick and stay home if you are sick.\n\nSymptoms \u2014 Both cause fever, cough, body aches and fatigue, though coronavirus is more likely to cause shortness of breath.\n\nTreatment \u2014 Neither virus is treatable with antibiotics (those only work on bacterial infections).\n\nHow they\u2019re different\n\nThe diseases have some critical differences, most importantly the death rate and lack of a vaccine.\n\nBased on the current numbers, someone with COVID-19 \u2014 the disease caused by coronavirus \u2014 is 23 to 68 times more likely to die than someone who contracts the flu, based on the latest data from the World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVaccine \u2014 A flu vaccine is available and effective to prevent the flu, or at least reduce its severity. A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available, and likely won\u2019t be for at least a year.\n\nTreatment \u2014 There are antiviral medications that address flu symptoms and can even shorten the duration of the illness, but such medications are still being tested for coronavirus.\n\nDeath rate \u2014 The fatality rate for this year\u2019s flu is estimated by the CDC at between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States. The coronavirus fatality rate was estimated at 2.3% of those infected by China\u2019s CDC and 3.4% by the World Health Organization (though many expect that to fall to the 1-2% range once we know more about how many people have been infected).\n\nInfections \u2014 Coronavirus has, so far, infected far fewer people. There were about 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. when Clarke tweeted, compared to an estimated 36 million to 51 million flu illnesses this season.\n\nKnowledge and research \u2014 Scientists know much more about the flu, such as details on how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms and treatment. Such details on coronavirus remain a point of debate.\n\nAll this to say, the CDC and other health officials have made it clear coronavirus presents a litany of risks the standard flu does not. The overwhelmed health care systems in first China, then Italy reinforced the severity of the disease and the breadth of its potential impact here.\n\nAnd the reaction of government alone \u2014 closing schools, bars, restaurants and more \u2014 makes it clear there is a stark difference between the two.\n\nOur rating\n\nRanting against those who would \"err on the side of caution,\" Clarke claimed coronavirus is just the \"damn flu.\"\n\nThere is indeed overlap in some basic areas \u2014 what symptoms it causes, how it is spread, who is most at risk, etc. But those pale in light of the stark differences.\n\nThere is no vaccine for coronavirus. Treatment approaches are not as well established. And most critically, someone who contracts COVID-19 is at least 20 times more likely to die of the disease than someone with the flu, based on the best available data.\n\nThe overall theme from Clarke\u2019s tweetstorm was that the coronavirus is no big deal \u2014 that the disease is just the same old flu virus with a heaping spoonful of government overreach.\n\nThat flies in the face of lots of established science, as well as what nations like China and Italy have already experienced.\n\nWe rate Clarke\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/03/15", "false_statement": " Coronavirus is just \u201cthe damn flu.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Coronavirus and the flu do have similarities in spread or symptoms but there are big differences in the death rate and treatment ability."}

Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and some of his colleagues sent a letter to President Donald Trump. More federal funding for states forces citizens of one state \"to pay for the poor decisions made in another state,\" Biggs wrote, according to a story about the letter in The Hill.\n\n\"States like New York, Illinois and California have been vocal in their demands for funding to bail out their pension systems, which were failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren\u2019t related to this crisis. While these states in particular prove the negative impacts of poor budgeting, bloated spending, and high taxes, the federal government should not be further backfilling the budget of any state or local government,\" Biggs wrote, according to The Hill. Biggs shared the story on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n\nLike Biggs, other Republican politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, criticized requests for help from states with high rates of infection. We wondered if Biggs was correct in saying that New York has been demanding federal funding to \"bail out\" its pension system, which was \"failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren\u2019t related to this crisis.\"\n\nThe National Governors Association, a bipartisan organization, is calling for $500 billion in federal funding for states, and New York supports that request, said Freeman Klopott, press officer for the state Division of the Budget.\n\nNew York\u2019s pension fund\n\nBiggs said New York\u2019s pension system was \"failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak.\"\n\nAn analysis of the pension systems in all 50 states in 2017 by the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts, released in June, found that New York was one of only eight states that had at least 90% of its pension obligations funded. New York had assets to cover 94.5% of its pension obligations.\n\nE.J. McMahon, who analyzes state finances at the conservative Empire Center for Public Policy, said no bailout is needed for New York\u2019s pension system, \"which by public-sector standards is among the best-funded in the nation.\"\n\nNew York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the pension fund, has called the fund \"well-funded and strong,\" despite the economic disruptions related to the pandemic.\n\nDiNapoli said in a statement that a bailout is not needed and has not been requested.\n\nThe pension systems in other states Biggs mentioned, Illinois and California, have different situations. Illinois has one of the three worst-funded systems, at 38.4% funded, and officials there have asked for a bailout of the pension fund.\n\nCalifornia's is close to being funded at the average ratio of all the states, at 68.9%, according to Pew, but it has since suffered. Biggs' home state of Arizona trails New York and California, at 62.2%, according to Pew.\n\nPandemic problems\n\nWe were also interested in the second part of Biggs\u2019 claim, regarding \"other programs not related to this crisis,\" because of reports that New York\u2019s finances were precarious before the pandemic. According to the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, before the coronavirus, New York faced a $7 billion budget gap. The subsequent economic downturn has worsened the state\u2019s finances.\n\n\"The shortfalls the state is experiencing in the current year are caused by tax revenue shortfalls attributable to the current crisis,\" said Dave Friedfel, director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission. Friedfel, however, criticized some of the state\u2019s budget priorities, which pre-date the pandemic, including state aid to wealthy school districts, \"ineffective economic development programs,\" and spending more on Medicaid than the budget authorized.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the state was expecting a 7% increase in revenue, but now it is expecting a 14% decline in revenue, said Klopott of the state Division of Budget.\n\nA state estimate on April 25 puts the loss of revenues at $13.3 billion this year and $61 billion over the next four years.\n\n\"In the absence of federal funding to offset that loss, we\u2019re preparing a plan to reduce state spending by $10.1 billion, which will reduce support for hospitals, police, firefighters, teachers, and the not-for-profits that provide services to the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including the elderly, children, and the homeless,\" Klopott said.\n\nIn an op-ed for the New York Daily News, DiNapoli pleaded for billions in unrestricted aid for New York, writing that lost state revenue as a result of the state\u2019s weakened economy \"stands to trigger significant reductions to schools, hospitals and a broad range of other vital services \u2014 cuts that would add to the human and economic damage brought on by COVID-19.\"\n\nOther experts we consulted said that states' financial struggles are attributable to the current crisis.\n\nLucy Dadayan, who leads the nonpartisan State Tax and Economic Review Project at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said that all states, regardless of the affiliations of their political leadership, will need federal funds, because all states are affected by lost tax revenue due to closed businesses.\n\nRichard Auxier, also with the Urban Institute-Tax Policy Center, said state and federal governments turned off the economy, cutting revenues to pay for everything that states pay for, such as public health, education, police protection, and roads and bridges.\n\nWe reached out to Biggs\u2019 spokesperson to ask for evidence to support this claim three times through email and left a telephone message with his office. We did not receive a response.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBiggs said that New York was one of several states demanding federal funds to bail out pension funds. He also claimed that New York and other states want federal funds to pay for programs not related to the pandemic.\n\nNew York\u2019s pension fund was one of the strongest in the country, according to a nonpartisan, nationwide analysis published in 2019, before the crisis hit state budgets. The New York state comptroller said that the pension system has not requested federal funds.\n\nThe other part of Biggs\u2019 statement \u2013 that the funding will pay for programs not related to the pandemic \u2013 is correct but misleading. The tax receipts that fund the full range of state governments have been sharply reduced by the pandemic. The federal funding sought by states would partly offset those pandemic losses.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\n\n\n\n", "date": "2020/05/07", "false_statement": " \u201cStates like New York, Illinois and California have been vocal in their demands for funding to bail out their pension systems, which were failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren\u2019t related to this crisis.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " New York's pension system is one of the best-funded in the nation and has not asked for federal funds.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has been talking to news outlets across New York State about the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nIn a recent appearance on WIVB-TV in Buffalo, she talked about the availability of ventilators.\n\nAnchor Luke Moretti asked Hochul: \"What\u2019s the situation with the ventilators? I know there was that bit of a back and forth between upstate, downstate a little while ago? Where do we stand right now? Are we in good shape with ventilators?\"\n\n\"Well, we always have been in good shape with ventilators,\" Hochul replied. Gov. Andrew Cuomo \"was simply trying to get an inventory to see if there are communities where there is a surplus of ventilators and he was simply saying if we can share 20 percent of your excess, your non-used ventilators, to help people in other parts of the state on a voluntary basis, that would be great. And, of course, there was a reaction to that, which was not positive, and that\u2019s unfortunate, because I think that we always respond in a way that we look out for each other.\"\n\nShe further described how first responders pitch in during snowstorms in other parts of the state, adding \"we were never going to leave anyone in Western New York without the support they need.\" She also said the urgent need for ventilators has subsided somewhat because of shipments of the breathing equipment from other states and China.\n\nWe were struck that she said Cuomo was \"simply saying\" that hospitals could share their ventilators on a \"voluntary\" basis.\n\nCuomo\u2019s original plan\n\nCuomo made clear during his daily briefing on April 3 that he intended to sign an executive order that would allow the state to move unused ventilators from one part of the state to another.\n\nThe headline the Cuomo administration wrote on the day of the announcement indicated as much: \"Amid Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, Governor Cuomo Announces Executive Order Allowing State to Redistribute Ventilators & Personal Protective Equipment to Hospitals with Highest Need.\"\n\nDuring a press briefing, Cuomo said that more ventilators were necessary to meet the state\u2019s needs, and that he has been working with suppliers in China.\n\n\"But we are going to have to redeploy ventilators from across the system,\" he said. \"In other words, there are hospitals that have ventilators. There are hospitals that have (personal protective) equipment. There are private-sector companies that have PPE equipment that they are not using that we are going to need to redeploy to the places in the hospitals where we need them,\" he said.\n\nCuomo also acknowledged during the briefing that hospital administrators who would lose ventilators under his plan are upset. \"I had a conversation with a hospital administrator yesterday,\" he said. \"I understand they don't want to give up their ventilators. Ventilators are expensive pieces of equipment. I understand that, even if they're not using them, they are reluctant to see them go out the door. The theory is if the government gets them, they will never get them back. I understand that. But I don't have an option.\"\n\nHe added later: \"I'm going to sign an executive order that says the state can take ventilators and (personal protective equipment) from institutions that don't need them now and redeploy them to other parts of the state and other hospitals that do need them. Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator.\"\n\nHe was asked later in that briefing about how many the state would need to redeploy, and he said the state hadn\u2019t done that calculation, but he added several hundred ventilators could be available.\n\n\"So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You\u2019re damn right I am,\" Cuomo said.\n\nReaction to the plan was swift, with upstate hospital executives and elected officials expressing their concerns.\n\nJody Lomeo, chief executive officer of Kaleida Health and chair-elect of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said that he was opposed to the executive order and would \"welcome and encourage us all to develop a more collaborative plan.\"\n\nThomas Quatroche Jr., Erie County Medical Center\u2019s chief executive officer and chair of the Healthcare Association of New York State, said Cuomo\u2019s executive order, as announced, would \"place our patients and community at risk.\"\n\nThe following day, April 4, Cuomo talked about taking 20 percent of a hospital\u2019s unused ventilators.\n\nCuomo\u2019s revised plan\n\nThe executive order that Cuomo described on April 3 was never signed.\n\nOn April 6, HANYS, the hospital group, said that it understood that any redeployment of equipment would be on a voluntary basis.\n\nOn April 7, Cuomo signed an executive order leaving the movement of medical supplies and equipment up to the state Department of Health. It does not mention the National Guard nor 20 percent of available inventory. It states: \"DOH may shift any such items not currently needed, or needed in the short term future by a health care facility, to be transferred to a facility in urgent need of such inventory, for purposes of ensuring New York hospitals, facilities and health care workers have the resources necessary to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribute them where there is an immediate need.\"\n\nIn reaction to the order that Cuomo did sign, hospital executives, such as Lomeo, and elected officials, such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said they were pleased by the change.\n\nQuatroche Jr., of ECMC and HANYS, said: \"We are pleased the governor\u2019s executive order gives the commissioner of health the ability to work collaboratively with hospitals to identify needs across New York State and provide resources in \u2018real time.\u2019\"\n\nWhat Hochul said\n\nHochul's answer to Moretti, the news broadcaster, came on April 8, one day after Cuomo signed an executive order that hospital executives found to be more cooperative than how the governor initially described it. We reached out to Hochul\u2019s office, and her spokesperson, Bryan Lesswing, said: \"The lieutenant governor was giving a status update on New York State's close coordination with hospitals to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, calling for state unity not division, and reinforcing Western New York's preparedness. Any other characterization is simply untrue and an unfair attack while New York State government officials have been consistently transparent in keeping New Yorkers updated with the latest facts.\"\n\nHochul\u2019s office also said that there was nothing contradictory in what Hochul said because the state was indeed working with hospitals to share equipment on a voluntary basis, and that she was speaking broadly about the current status with ventilators and then talked about the dialogue between upstate and downstate in Moretti\u2019s question.\n\nOur ruling\n\nHochul said Cuomo was simply saying that hospitals could share 20 percent of their unused ventilators on a voluntary basis.\n\nThat\u2019s not how hospital executives and other elected officials heard Cuomo describe his initial plan, thus explaining the immediate backlash. And those who listened to the governor\u2019s televised briefing heard him say this: \"So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You\u2019re damn right I am.\"\n\nParsing that quote to find any semblance of \"voluntary\" is beyond challenging.\n\nCuomo said the state would move hospital equipment from one part of the state to harder-hit areas that desperately needed them because of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nWhen the plan changed, after significant backlash, hospitals and others praised the administration for acting collaboratively.\n\nHochul misled viewers about what happened.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/04/14", "false_statement": " Gov.

So, N95 masks block few, if any, virions (virus particles).\"\n\nIn other words, the post asserts the virus is smaller than the filter on the N95 mask, so the N95 mask doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut that\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nExperts say this claim flies in the face of numerous studies and reflects a failure to grasp fundamental principles of how viruses behave and how face masks work.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\n\nHere\u2019s what we found.\n\nVirus particles don\u2019t exist alone\n\nThe science of mask functionality gets really small, really fast. The unit of measurement here is microns \u2014 1/1000th of a millimeter.\n\nThe size-based argument against N95 laid out in this claim assumes mask filtering works something like water flowing through a net \u2014 particles in the water smaller than the net opening pass through, while larger items don\u2019t.\n\nBut the physics involved don\u2019t work like that at all.\n\nThe COVID-19 particle is indeed around 0.1 microns in size, but it is always bonded to something larger.\n\n\"There is never a naked virus floating in the air or released by people,\" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who specializes in airborne transmission of viruses.\n\nThe virus attaches to water droplets or aerosols (i.e. really small droplets) that are generated by breathing, talking, coughing, etc. These consist of water, mucus protein and other biological material and are all larger than 1 micron.\n\n\"Breathing and talking generate particles around 1 micron in size, which will be collected by N95 respirator filters with very high efficiency,\" said Lisa Brosseau, a retired professor of environmental and occupational health sciences who spent her career researching respiratory protection.\n\nHealth care precautions for COVID-19 are built around stopping the droplets, since \"there\u2019s not a lot of evidence for aerosol spread of COVID-19,\" said Patrick Remington, a former CDC epidemiologist and director of the Preventive Medicine Residency Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nSize matters, but not how you think\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only logical flaw in this claim.\n\nThe N95 filter is indeed physically around the 0.3 micron size. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can only stop particles larger than that. It works well for particles above that size, and actually snares particles below that size better than those at exactly the 0.3 level.\n\n\"N95 have the worst filtration efficiency for particles around 0.3,\" Marr said. \"If you\u2019re smaller than that those are actually collected even better. It\u2019s counterintuitive because masks do not work like sieving out larger particles. It\u2019s not like pasta in a colander and small ones don\u2019t get through.\"\n\nN95 masks actually have that name because they are 95% efficient at stopping particles in their least efficient particle size range \u2014 in this case those around 0.3 microns.\n\nWhy do they work better for smaller ones? There are a number of factors at play, but here are two main ones noted by experts:\n\nThe first is something called \"Brownian motion,\" the name given to a physical phenomenon in which particles smaller than 0.3 microns move in an erratic, zig-zagging kind of motion. This motion greatly increases the chance they will be snared by the mask fibers.\n\nThe second is the N95 mask itself uses electrostatic absorption, meaning particles are drawn to the fiber and trapped, instead of just passing through.\n\n\"Although these particles are smaller than the pores, they can be pulled over by the charged fibers and get stuck,\" said Professor Jiaxing Huang, a materials scientist at Northwestern University working to develop a new type of medical face mask. \"When the charges are dissipated during usage or storage, the capability of stopping virus-sized particles diminishes. This is the main reason of not recommending the reuse of N95 masks.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post said the \"N95 masks block few, if any\" COVID-19 particles due to their size.\n\nThis claim \u2014 attempting to disprove a fundamental piece of protective gear used by healthcare professionals around the world \u2014 is nonsense.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus itself is indeed smaller than the N95 filter size, but the virus always travels attached to larger particles that are consistently snared by the filter. And even if the particles were smaller than the N95 filter size, the erratic motion of particles that size and the electrostatic attraction generated by the mask means they would be consistently caught as well.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/06/04", "false_statement": " \u201cN95 masks block few, if any\u201d COVID-19 particles due to their size.\t\t", "true_statement": " This attempt to discredit a fundamental piece of protective gear used and studied around the globe fails to account for several fundamental scientific principles. The COVID-19 particle is small, but it always exists bonded to larger particles of water, protein, mucus and other materials expelled by breathing, coughing, etc. These are all well above the 0.3 micron size of the N95 filter. The N95 filter also filters particles smaller than 0.3 microns very efficiently because particles under that size have a high amount of erratic movement and are electrostatically drawn to the mask fibers."}

Jeff Jackson has tried to keep his constituents informed by posting on social media.\n\nJackson, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, regularly tweets stats about the pandemic. And on March 19, he urged people to reschedule elective procedures to free up space for coronavirus patients.\n\n\"Hospitals are starting to cancel elective surgeries and doing their best to empty hospital beds to prepare for a surge. Our hospital beds are typically 85% full across the state. If we don't significantly reduce that number within the next week, that's a major problem,\" Jackson tweeted.\n\nIs it true that, under normal circumstances, hospitals operate at 85% capacity?\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find a supporting number. But we did learn that it\u2019s normal for NC hospitals to treat patients while their facilities are close to being full.\n\nAccustomed to high capacity\n\nWe reached out to Jackson about his tweet. He said he heard the figure from officials with North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services. So we reached out to them.\n\nDHHS spokeswoman SarahLewis Peel responded by email, but didn\u2019t give an exact number.\n\n\"On any given day, our hospitals \u2014 by design \u2014 operate at 90 to 100% capacity. That\u2019s why we have sought waivers to allow critical access hospitals to operate above their licensed capacity,\" Peel wrote.\n\nDHHS later clarified that those numbers are usually during flu season and that evidence is anecdotal. It\u2019s from speaking with hospital managers and suppliers.\n\nDavid Weber, the associate chief medical officer at UNC Health, told NC Health News something similar. He said that, with the closure and downsizing of many rural hospitals, there are fewer beds overall across the state.\n\n\"The U.S., compared to years ago, has less open beds and on a normal busy week, you know, most of our hospitals, including UNC, would be running between 90 and 100% occupancy,\" he said.\n\nHowever, we need hard numbers -- not anecdotes -- to get the most accurate picture.\n\nOther estimates\n\nSo, what stats are available? The North Carolina Health Association had a lower estimate, but its latest figures are from 2018.\n\nCynthia Charles, the association\u2019s vice president for communications, pointed to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, the average US hospital occupancy rate was 65.5 percent.\n\n\"For North Carolina, (the) average hospital occupancy rate is 61% for 2018,\" she said.\n\nOther estimates PolitiFact found put the average occupancy rate in the 60-to-75 percent range.\n\nCharles noted that people may get different estimates depending on how they account for beds, among other things.\n\n\"There could be a difference in how they\u2019re defining capacity, for example whether they are looking at licensed vs. staffed beds, or whether they are considering \u2018current state\u2019 staffing as capacity,\" she said.\n\nBigger hospitals, fuller spaces\n\nMark Holmes, director of UNC\u2019s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, agreed with Charles. Holmes said there are different ways to count beds and averages. Staffing levels could also come into play, he said.\n\nHolmes and his colleagues recently analyzed cost reports filed to Medicare in 2018. Those numbers suggested a 58% occupancy average, he said. It\u2019s likely that some small, rural hospitals bring down the statewide average.\n\n\"Some of our smaller hospitals are at less than 20%,\" he said. \"But larger ones \u2014 like Duke and UNC\u2014 are indeed at 85% on average throughout the year.\"\n\nThe Sheps Center recently published a study of NC hospital occupancy rates.\n\nImportant final point: hospital capacity should not be viewed as the sole indicator of whether it can continue treating patients, Holmes said.\n\nHospitals need four things to properly treat patients, he said:\n\nsquare feet a license from the government equipment (including beds), and qualified staff.\n\nHospitals may face limits in terms of square footage, Holmes said. But some government agencies are relaxing those regulations and hospitals are creating space where they can, such as dormitories.\n\nIndeed, Weber said UNC Health is shifting its units around and even using tents outside to triage and treat people with ailments that aren\u2019t as serious as COVID-19.\n\n\"So the square feet and licenses are less important than, in general, the attention they often receive,\" Holmes said in an email. \"Most people who study this issue think the biggest limitations to capacity are equipment\u2014 e.g. ventilators \u2014 and qualified staff, especially as the epidemic infects staff and their family members.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nJackson said North Carolina\u2019s hospital beds \"are typically 85% full across the state.\"\n\nThe way he worded his tweet makes it seems like all hospitals are usually at 85% capacity. That\u2019s not right. It depends on the hospital and it depends on the season.\n\nBut he has a point that many of North Carolina\u2019s hospitals routinely treat patients while their facilities are close to maximum capacity. So we rate his claim Half True.", "date": "2020/04/03", "false_statement": " North Carolina \u201chospital beds are typically 85% full across the state.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Records show that NC hospitals are, on average throughout the year, between 60-to-75% full. However, medical professionals say Jackson is right that hospitals operate at maximum capacity during certain parts of the year, such as flu season."}

We looked at that claim in detail before and found that the genetic sequence of the virus shows no signs of genetic engineering.\n\nA research team at Scripps Research compared the virus to viruses that had hit humans, such as the one behind the SARS outbreak, and viruses that are found in animals. All the evidence pointed to a natural source.\n\n\"We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThere are unresolved concerns that protective lapses at the lab may have allowed a virus collected from nature to escape, and to be clear, that is an unproven allegation, and Chinese officials deny it. But that is different from the virus being intentionally manufactured by human hands.\n\nThe lab was funded by Obama \"in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars!\"\n\nThe correct amount sent to the Wuhan virology lab is $598,500, and that was spread over five years, according to the American research group running the project.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the lab, that work and the U.S. funding.\n\nIn 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed a project by the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including many in Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam and China.\n\nThe 2014 project focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. In 2018, alliance researchers reported they had found a virus in bats very similar to SARS.\n\n\"If we know what viruses are out there in wildlife, and which people are getting infected, we have a chance to stop pandemics dead in their tracks,\" the group\u2019s president Peter Daszak said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe group contracted the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct the genetic analyses of the viruses that were being collected in the field. The lab was selected after it was approved by the U.S. State Department and NIH.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health website shows a total award of about $3.4 million over six years to EcoHealth Alliance. The group\u2019s spokesman Robert Kessler told us that, of that, the Wuhan lab received just under $600,000.\n\nThat\u2019s about 85% less than the Facebook post asserted.\n\nThat NIH spending included about $265,000 for the lab under the Trump administration. In 2019, NIH renewed the grant to EcoHealth Alliance for another five years. That decision came on Trump\u2019s watch and he said \"we will end that grant very quickly.\"\n\n\"President Trump just announced\"\n\nThere is a virology lab in Wuhan, and it did get money from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But the post exaggerates what Trump said about that.\n\nIn an April 17 White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter from the conservative website Newsmax asked Trump about the grant. Here\u2019s the exchange:\n\nReporter: \"(There\u2019s a) report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?\"\n\nTrump: \"The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I\u2019ve been hearing about that. And we\u2019ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area \u2014 we\u2019re looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly.\n\n\"But it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We\u2019re going to look at it and take a look.

Wengui fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party.

Other conspiratorial websites, such as pro-Trump outlet the Epoch Times, have amplified the video on social media.\n\nWe could find no other evidence that Chinese officials are cremating coronavirus victims alive. And to be clear, at no point does the video offer any firsthand evidence.

But by May, she voted for a measure that requires a House committee to study remote voting.\n\nInitial reluctance\n\nMarch 24, interviews:\n\nOn the idea of holding a remote vote on the $2 trillion stimulus, Pelosi told MSNBC: \"There are serious constitutional, technological and security concerns about it. They can be addressed, but for right now, we're just working very hard to get unanimous consent so we can get this bill done, and then consider what the options are later.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN moments later, she was even more terse, The Hill reported, saying it may be an option in the future, but at the moment \"we're not prepared for (it).\"\n\nApril 9, teleconference with reporters:\n\nPelosi said any changes to the requirement that House members vote in person are a long way off, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, saying that Pelosi said: \"We\u2019re not there yet, and we\u2019re not going to be there no matter how many letters somebody sends in \u2014 with all the respect in the world for that.\"\n\nHer concerns included the security of any technology used, the constitutionality of changes to the rules and the time needed to be sure any new system is well thought out and bipartisan.\n\nPelosi\u2019s tone changed in the weeks before the May 10 Facebook post as the need for social distancing amid the outbreak became better understood.\n\nOpen to study\n\nApril 16, teleconference with reporters:\n\n\"I've said\" to the House committee chairs about remote voting, \"give our members options; show us how we can do what. What are the options that the Constitution, the rules of the House, the technology, the security enables us to do, and that is what they have been working on. Until we have an appropriate way to do it, we can\u2019t do it. So, it\u2019s not about being negative on it, it\u2019s just, show us the way \u2026 . Everybody is working so hard on all of these initiatives, including how we can come together, whether it\u2019s by proxy voting or remote voting or whatever it is. When we are ready, we will do it.\"\n\nSometimes the terms remote and proxy voting are used interchangeably, but they mean different things in this context. Remote refers to the concept of a member using technology to cast a vote; proxy refers to a member who is not on the House floor authorizing another member, who is on the floor, to cast their ballot.\n\nApril 26, CNN interview:\n\nAsked if it\u2019s time to allow remote voting during the pandemic, Pelosi said: \"I'm all for doing the remote voting by proxy. I want it to be bipartisan. The Republican leader, Mr. (Kevin) McCarthy, has assured me that he will consider this. He's not there yet; he could be there. But whether he is or not, we will \u2014 our process was to strive to make it bipartisan.\"\n\nMay 20, authorization:\n\nPelosi formally authorized a 45-day period during which House members can vote by proxy. The House had adopted the change in rules on May 15, in a 217-189 vote, mostly along party lines; Pelosi voted yes. Any member attending a House vote can cast as many as 10 votes on behalf of colleagues.\n\nThe new rules also allow, pending certification, for a process in which lawmakers will eventually be able to cast their votes from home, either via a secure online portal or a video conferencing system. The measure requires the House Administration Committee study the feasibility of using technology to conduct remote voting in the House.\n\nOn May 26, House Republicans sued Pelosi to stop the new proxy voting system, claiming it is unconstitutional.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed Pelosi said \"Congress shall not vote remotely because it is not secure!\" while also saying that \"Americans should all vote for president by mail!\"\n\nPelosi is a prominent supporter of voters casting ballots by mail.

But Snopes, which fact-checked another claim that Koontz predicted the new coronavirus outbreak, pointed out several ways the current outbreak differs from what\u2019s described in the novel.

But in China, where more than 77,600 cases have been confirmed, the death toll is 2,663.\n\nThe Facebook post we\u2019re checking similarly suggests that Browne\u2019s \"End of Days\" predicted the new coronavirus.

The outbreak started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread to 24 countries.\n\nOne of the most popular conspiracies about the coronavirus is that it was created in a lab, possibly as a bioweapon. We\u2019ve previously said those claims are unproven \u2014 and the Natural News story has similar shortcomings.\n\nThe website says that \"every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists.\" But none of the researchers that has analyzed the virus has come to that conclusion.\n\nAccording to the CDC, both the agency and Chinese authorities have isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest \"a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\"\n\nWe analyzed the eight publications the CDC lists on its landing page about coronavirus. None asserts that the virus was engineered by humans.\n\nRELATED: PolitiFact\u2019s coronavirus coverage in one place\n\nOne study, which analyzed the genetic sequence of the coronavirus, was published Jan. 30 in the journal The Lancet. It says the 2019 coronavirus is a human betacoronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and likely comes from bats.\n\n\"Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans,\" the study reads.\n\nEarly reports on the virus focused on the fact that many patients were linked to the Wuhan market. That suggested animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC, but later, a growing number of patients reported not having any connection to the market. That suggested the coronavirus was spreading person-to-person.\n\nOther blogs and social media users have speculated that a lab near Wuhan could be the source of the virus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and SARS.

Hundreds of cases in people 17 and under have been reported in Wisconsin, and tens of thousands in the U.S.\n\nThere are several diseases that are especially tough on kids.\n\nMeasles, chickenpox and even this year\u2019s most common strain of influenza in Wisconsin target children and can cause serious, even life-threatening complications.\n\nSo the world breathed a sigh of relief when the first reports about children and COVID-19 seemed to show that this novel coronavirus wouldn\u2019t be one of those diseases.\n\nA preliminary report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published April 6, 2020, found that children make up only a small portion of U.S. coronavirus cases thus far and are less likely to become seriously ill.\n\nAs the debate continues about how quickly to relax restrictions and reopen the country, that information has become a key part of the reopen-now argument.\n\nState Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, dove into the issue in the comments section of an April 28, 2020 post on her Facebook page that criticized Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for not opening playgrounds and restrooms at parks.\n\nReplying to a commenter, she wrote, \"In fact, New York is considering opening schools because children don\u2019t seem to be getting this virus.\"\n\nA few days later, though, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared that all schools in the state would be closed for the remainder of the academic year. (Evers made the call weeks earlier that Wisconsin schools would be closed through June.)\n\nBut is Brandtjen right about the rest of her claim \u2014 that \"children don\u2019t seem to be getting this virus\"?\n\nThe numbers\n\nAs of May 21, 2020, the CDC reported that 40,457 of the country\u2019s more than 1 million coronavirus cases occurred in patients 17 and under.\n\nTo be sure, that is a tiny fraction of overall cases, clocking in at just 3% of the 1.2 million cases listed by the CDC. But it\u2019s still more than 40,000 children who have gotten sick with COVID-19, in the official count. Others, of course, may have gotten sick and never been tested.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the same pattern holds: 257 cases have been reported in patients 9 and under, and 695 in patients ages 10-19 (the state Department of Health Services uses different age breakdowns than the CDC).\n\nThe two age groups account for just 7% of the state\u2019s total coronavirus cases, and even less for whom the disease turned more serious. Just 32 people under the age of 20 have been hospitalized by the virus, according to the DHS website.\n\nAlthough the numbers are small, they\u2019re there \u2014 and there, too, are the rare cases that have turned fatal. Wisconsin has avoided the death of a child from the virus so far, but nationally, a handful of deaths have occurred in pediatric cases.\n\nSo, children do seem to be getting this virus.\n\nThe nuance\n\nBut what early data and the raw numbers show is that they seem to be contracting it far less, and less seriously, too.\n\nThat\u2019s what Brandtjen pointed to when asked to back up her claim. In a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin she said her choice of words in saying that children don\u2019t \"seem\" to be getting the virus acknowledged that nuance.\n\nBrandtjen cited a CDC webpage on kids and coronavirus which notes that children don\u2019t appear to be at higher risk, and most U.S. cases appear in adults.\n\nShe also quoted a Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin news release stating that \"one of the main understandings was that (COVID-19) didn\u2019t affect healthy kids as seriously as adults.\" In the release, the hospital wrote that only a handful of children there tested positive for the virus, and all went home after brief hospitalizations.\n\nThe Children\u2019s release, however, brings up another distinction in the conversation about kids and COVID-19: a new, more serious disease known as Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or PIMS.\n\nNo kids at Children\u2019s have presented with PIMS symptoms, the release says, and research on the link between PIMS and the coronavirus is still limited. But doctors in New York, which as of May 12 was investigating 102 cases of the syndrome and three deaths, suspect COVID is involved.

They come from the shutdown.\n\n\"The economy is what\u2019s killing people,\" Baker said in his April 23 video. \"Homicide, suicide, heart attacks, mental health institutions, alcoholism, drug use. That\u2019s called deaths of despair.\"\n\nBaker cited a stat that when unemployment goes up 1%, deaths of despair go up 58,000 over five years. And he noted that unemployment now is through the roof. At the end of his piece, he doubled down on his key point.\n\n\"It\u2019s not the coronavirus that\u2019s killing people. It is the economy. Way more people are dying because of the economy and unemployment than will ever be killed by coronavirus.\"\n\nWe reached Baker, and when we explained the underlying research to him, he acknowledged that the numbers didn\u2019t add up.\n\n\"I admit, I was wrong,\" Baker said.\n\nHe said he heard the 58,000 figure from a reliable source, and added, \"this virus is a lot less dangerous than people think it is.\"\n\nSince an extended economic downturn can cause some kinds of deaths to rise, and there are more and more warnings about that, it\u2019s worth a moment to unpack what the real research shows. We\u2019ll start with the researcher whose work, indirectly, lies behind Baker\u2019s central argument.\n\nThe original 1976 study\n\nMore than four decades ago, in a report for the congressional Joint Economic Committee, medical sociologist Harvey Brenner assessed the impact of sustained unemployment. Brenner found that in a five-year period, a 1.4% rise in unemployment added about 30,000 deaths due to suicides (1,540), homicides (1,740), liver disease (870) and cardiovascular/kidney disease (26,440).\n\nFactoring in America\u2019s growing population, a recent opinion piece estimated the added deaths to be 58,000. That piece, citing Brenner, was the source of Baker\u2019s claim.\n\nBut Brenner, now a professor at the University of North Texas, described how the video fundamentally misused his work.\n\nBrenner said his work is about \"the permanent loss of jobs,\" not an immediate rise in unemployment, no matter how dramatic. The deaths he identified started two years after a sustained economic downturn.\n\n\"It is not now statistically possible to render a verdict on the economy-based mortality implications of the immediate downturn of the past two months,\" Brenner said. \"Baker\u2019s video is not factually correct.\"\n\nWhat other research shows on a recession\u2019s health effects\n\nBaker builds his entire case on Brenner\u2019s findings. But over the decades, other researchers have cast doubt on Brenner\u2019s core conclusion, some going so far as to say he got things upside down.\n\nThere are deaths of despair, said Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They wrote a New York Times bestseller \"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.\" The deaths primarily were among less educated white Americans and started in the 1990s.\n\n\"They rose before the Great Recession, they grew during the Great Recession and they grew after the Great Recession,\" Case and Deaton wrote in a recent op-ed. \"The line of rising deaths shows no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy.\"\n\nCase and Deaton point to Spain and Greece as the poster children of the beneficial effects of recession.\n\n\"Unemployment in Greece and Spain more than tripled, to the point where more than a quarter of the population was unemployed,\" they wrote. \"Yet Greece and Spain saw increases in life expectancy that were among the best in Europe.\"\n\nAs counterintuitive as it might sound, mortality from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. typically falls during a downturn, as Christopher Ruhm, a University of Virginia economist found. One study reported that in a lackluster economy, people exercise more and smoke less. That\u2019s particularly telling, since heart related deaths were a huge factor in Brenner\u2019s total.\n\nRuhm cautions, though, that the tie between the economy and any given disease is complex and changeable. The reduction in heart disease deaths seen in decades past was not as strong in recent years and might give way further in the current crisis if fear of the virus keeps people from seeking treatment.\n\nStill, he called the statistics in Baker\u2019s video \"silly.\" Ruhm\u2019s overarching warning is that the country is in new territory.\n\n\"The fundamental fact is that we can\u2019t extrapolate from the recent past to understand the effects of the coronavirus,\" he said. \"The nature and magnitude of the effects are just too different from past experience.\"\n\nAnd as he and other researchers have noted, if the country hadn\u2019t moved to stop the spread of COVID-19, deaths would have mounted astronomically \u2014 which would have brought economic devastation in its own right.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA TikTok user said it\u2019s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, \"that\u2019s killing people.\" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other \"diseases of despair.\"\n\nThe researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn\u2019t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus.\n\nNo analyst said the immediate scale of deaths could be tied to rising unemployment.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "date": "2020/04/23", "false_statement": " \u201cIt\u2019s not the coronavirus that\u2019s killing people.

The main thing to know is there are no set amounts paid to hospitals for either type of patient.\n\nThe $17,500 claimed roughly matches the average amount Medicare paid hospitals before this year\u2019s outbreak for a patient with a COVID-like respiratory infection, such as pneumonia, who needed a certain amount of care. But private insurance typically pays twice as much as Medicare does, Tricia Neuman, who leads Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s program on Medicare policy, told PolitiFact.\n\nAs for the amount claimed for a flu patient, \"no hospitalization ever costs $750 and has not in 30 years,\" said Gerard Anderson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management.\n\nThe 20% add-on\n\nThe federal government has decided to pay hospitals extra for treating COVID-19 patients on Medicare.\n\nCongress added the provision because hospitals have lost revenue from routine care and elective surgeries that they couldn't provide during the crisis, and because the cost of providing even routine services to COVID patients has increased.\n\nFrom March through June, hospitals will lose an estimated $202.6 billion as a result of the high cost of COVID-19 care and lost revenue from canceled procedures, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nUnder the CARES Act, the largest of the three federal stimulus laws enacted in response to the coronavirus, Medicare pays hospitals a 20% \"add on\" to its regular payment for COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut there is no indication that hospitals are over-identifying patients as having COVID-19 for the sake of padding their revenue. If anything, evidence suggests the illness is being underdiagnosed.\n\nDollar amounts in the claim are off\n\nMedicare pays hospitals based on a diagnosis; whether a patient dies does not affect the amount. And even then, the same diagnosis might trigger one reimbursement amount at one hospital, and a different payment at a hospital in another location, to take into account wage differences across the country and other factors.\n\nNeuman said $17,500 was roughly the average amount paid for a particular type of patient with a COVID-related diagnosis \u2014 one who has respiratory infection with complications and who needs a ventilator for up to 96 hours.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe claim is unsupported.\n\nMicrochips\n\nWe found no evidence of proposals or legislation, Democratic or otherwise, to promote implanting microchips to counter the coronavirus.\n\nNot that this would even make sense as a solution to coronavirus.\n\nEven the smallest microchips \"are rather large, such that none would ever fit into a vaccine needle \u2014 these are very small-bore needles,\" Wilbur Chen, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, previously told PolitiFact.\n\nOther fact-checkers have traced the assertion in the Facebook post to an inaccurate interpretation of comments made by Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who has focused his efforts on global health.\n\nOn March 18, Gates took part in a forum on Reddit in which he was asked, \"What changes are we going to have to make to how businesses operate to maintain our economy while providing social distancing?\"\n\nGates responded, \"The question of which businesses should keep going is tricky. Certainly, food supply and the health system. We still need water, electricity and the internet. Supply chains for critical things need to be maintained. Countries are still figuring out what to keep running. Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.\"\n\nThe website Biohackinfo.com soon posted a story on Gates\u2019 comments headlined, \"Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.\" It included the line that by \"\u2018digital certificates,\u2019 Gates was referring to implantable \u2018QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS.'\"\n\nThis misinterpretation was amplified on April 13, when Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, told radio host Joe Piscopo, \"Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate. I have conservative friends who say it\u2019s ridiculous, and others say absolutely.\" But, Stone added, Gates \"and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they\u2019ve been tested. Over my dead body. Mandatory vaccinations? No way, Jose!\"\n\nThis conversation was spread further by coverage in the New York Post and the Russian news service RT, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nNone of this is correct.\n\n\"Digital certificates\" are electronic information used to securely communicate over the internet, and Gates never mentioned microchips. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told FactCheck.org that Gates was referring to digital certificates as part of an effort to create a system of home-based, self-administered testing for COVID-19 that would involve a secure connection with health officials.\n\nMeanwhile, unrelated research funded by the Gates Foundation proposed recording vaccination history on a patient\u2019s skin using an invisible dye that could be read by a smartphone and last up to five years.\n\nKevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study, told Reuters, \"The quantum dot dye technology is not a microchip or human-implantable capsule, and to my knowledge there are no plans to use this for coronavirus.\"\n\nThere are legitimate concerns about privacy in some of the contact-tracing methods being considered to prevent the spread of coronavirus, experts say. However, \"the fear of insertion of tracking chips and other things like that into our bodies has been a longstanding bogeyman,\" said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida who has written extensively about conspiracy theories. \"There is a lot of tracking that goes on, but the suggestion that it\u2019s being used in this manner and this way seems absurd.\"\n\nMandatory vaccinations\n\nThis part of the claim isn\u2019t as far-fetched. Many Democrats and some Republicans do support narrowing exemptions to mandatory vaccinations based on personal beliefs.\n\nStates have had the authority to require vaccinations for more than a century, and they use that authority all the time, with certain exceptions allowed.\n\nIn the 1905 case Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that a mandatory-vaccination law was a legitimate exercise of state power to protect public health and safety.\n\nSince that decision, every state has instituted a variety of vaccine requirements, usually for school-age children. All but five states have exceptions for non-medical reasons. Some are for religious exemptions, some are for \"personal beliefs,\" and some are for both. (The National Conference of State Legislatures has the full list.)\n\nIn the past several years, certain states, led in many cases by Democratic lawmakers but often with some bipartisan support, have moved to limit the religious- or personal-belief exemptions to vaccinations. This came amid concerns about outbreaks of measles and other diseases that were believed to stem from growing opposition to vaccination.\n\nUltimately, several states narrowed exemptions in 2019, including California, Maine, New York and Washington. They did so over the opposition of groups on the right and left who are skeptical of the value of vaccinations, a perspective the medical community strongly opposes. (Read our analysis of complaints about the safety of vaccines.)\n\nThe precedent set by Jacobson vs. Massachusetts continues to be cited, three academic experts at Boston University \u2014 Wendy K. Mariner, George J. Annas, and Leonard H. Glantz \u2014 have written in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n\"A law that authorizes mandatory vaccination during an epidemic of a lethal disease, with refusal punishable by a monetary penalty, like the one at issue in Jacobson, would undoubtedly be found constitutional under the low constitutional test of \u2018rationality review,\u2019\" the co-authors wrote, as long as regulators determined the vaccine was safe and effective.\n\nEven without an ongoing epidemic, they added, such a requirement \"would probably be upheld\" as long as the disease was still spreading to some degree and as long as the vaccine was safe.\n\nThe federal government could theoretically impose stronger mandates, but it has not done so, Richard Hughes IV, a vaccine specialist at Avalere Health, wrote in the journal Health Affairs. The federal government could do this through a law pre-empting state policies or by using federal funding as leverage against the states, Hughes wrote. But Mariner said she\u2019s doubtful about this scenario, and there is no evidence of legislation of this type for now.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post says, \"The Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated.\"\n\nOn microchips, there\u2019s no evidence that implanted microchips are being contemplated in a serious way to fight the coronavirus. This appears to stem from a warped translation of comments by Gates.\n\nAs for mandatory vaccinations, the idea that Democrats are pushing for this power is exaggerated, because the Supreme Court long ago decided that the government has that power. This authority is now used in all 50 states. A minority that includes some Democrats and some Republicans oppose efforts to limit religious or personal exemptions.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "date": "2020/04/10", "false_statement": " \u201cThe Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " There\u2019s no evidence that implanted microchips are being contemplated in a serious way to fight the coronavirus.

Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has been touted as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

She is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative.\n\nBelow the headline is an article that originally appeared in The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning publication, that reports on an executive order issued by Whitmer in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article does not say that the order bans gardening, but that it does restrict the sale of gardening supplies.\n\nIn reality, executive order 2020-42, which went into effect April 9, 2020, requires larger stores to block off certain areas of their sales floors as a way of limiting the number of people in those stores. The order does not ban gardening or the sale of any product, including, as we mentioned in a previous fact-check, American flags.\n\nThe numbers of coronavirus cases in Michigan have surged in recent weeks. As of April 14, the Wolverine State ranked fourth \u2014 behind New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, according to the New York Times.\n\nNearly half of Michigan\u2019s cases are in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, according to Johns Hopkins University. Both the state and the county have a COVID-19 fatality rate of 6%.\n\nIt\u2019s in that climate that Whitmer issued this order, subtitled the \"Temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life,\" which extended and added to a stay-at-home order issued March 23.\n\nTiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for the governor, told PolitiFact that Whitmer\u2019s order does not ban Michiganders from buying any item.\n\nThe order says that stores larger than 50,000 square feet must close areas \u2014 \"by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means \u2014 that are dedicated to the following classes of goods: Carpet or flooring, furniture, garden centers and plant nurseries, and paint.\"\n\nReferring to that restriction at a news conference announcing the order, Whitmer said: \"If you\u2019re not buying food or medicine or other essential items, you should not be going to the store.\"\n\nAs to gardening, a frequently asked questions document released by the governor\u2019s office states: \"The order does not prohibit homeowners from tending to their own yards as they see fit.\"\n\nGrocery stores, of course, remain open. And neither the order nor the FAQs mention any restriction on the sale of fruit or seeds.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA headline shared on social media inaccurately describes an order that Whitmer issued in response to the coronavirus.\n\nThe order does not prohibit gardening or the sale of any particular product in Michigan.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIt is inaccurate on several fronts. Medical experts now agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the states cited in the post have distributed masks to inmates.\n\nMeanwhile, states that are releasing inmates are considering the potential danger to the public in deciding which ones to release.\n\nClaim overstates prison releases\n\nAcross the nation in response to the coronavirus, many more inmates are being released from local jails \u2014 which hold people charged with crimes or convicted of low-level crimes \u2014 than from prisons, which mostly hold people convicted of felonies. That\u2019s according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, and the New York Times. (In Florida, an inmate released from the Hillsborough County jail, where he was being held on nonviolent drug charges, was charged with second-degree murder the next day.)\n\nSome are being released from prisons. In New York, Michigan and California, thousands of prison inmates have been released in response to the coronavirus. The Facebook claim goes too far in characterizing them all as posing a threat to kill.\n\nIn New York, Cuomo announced in April that pregnant women with less than six months remaining on their sentences for nonviolent offenses would be released from prison. The state announced in March that up to 1,100 inmates being held in local jails for low-level parole violations and deemed not a danger to the public would be released to stem the flow of coronavirus cases in the correctional system.\n\nMichigan is releasing 200 prison inmates per week because of the coronavirus, WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich., reported on April 14. The state is looking to first release inmates eligible for parole who are nonviolent offenders older than 60 with health issues, though no offenses are off-limits, the report said.\n\nCalifornia announced in March that it planned to release as many as 3,500 prison inmates by expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with 60 days or less left on their sentences.\n\nWhy COVID-19 spreads in prisons\n\nCorrectional and detention facilities pose \"unique challenges\" in combating COVID-19, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\n\nInmates live, work and eat in close settings, heightening the potential for the virus to spread. The virus can be brought into the facility in many ways, including through staff, medical professionals or others who enter from the outside. And options for isolating inmates are limited, the CDC notes.\n\nAcross the country, more than 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 of them have died, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that reports on criminal justice.\n\nStaff and inmates are required to wear masks amid large outbreaks:\n\nNew York: More than 1,200 prison staff have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the state. The Department of Corrections requires all staff to wear face masks while on duty and supplies all inmates with surgical-type masks.\n\nMichigan: There are more than 2,100 COVID-19 infections among prisoners and Michigan ranks third for the number of prisoner cases, according to the Marshall Project. Each prison employee and inmate has received three masks that can be laundered and worn again, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections. Staff are expected to wear a mask during their entire shift, and prisoners are expected to wear masks except while eating, sleeping or showering.\n\nCalifornia: More than 430 cases of COVID-19, including five deaths, have been confirmed at the California Institution for Men in Chino, with tents being set up to provide more space and treatment for inmates, the Sacramento Bee reported. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it provides masks and hand sanitizer to all staff and prisoners.\n\nThe effectiveness of masks\n\nWhile masks alone cannot stop the spread of the coronavirus, health officials agree that facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, help slow the spread of the virus, as we\u2019ve reported.\n\nThe CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering while out in public and in areas where social distancing isn\u2019t possible. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snugly and are made of multiple layers.\n\nNew research since the start of the coronavirus outbreak supports the use of masks.\n\nFor correctional facilities, a May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with physical distancing, movement restrictions and other measures.\n\n\"Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons, correctional and detention facility staff members, and the communities to which they return,\" the report said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them.\n\nExperts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus.

That\u2019s because you can contract the virus by touching surfaces that have the respiratory droplets of an infected person on them.\n\nBut how long can coronavirus germs live on those surfaces? An infographic from KIRO-TV in Seattle offers some clarity.\n\nAccording to the graphic, which was published March 18 on Facebook, the coronavirus can live for \"up to 3 hours in the air, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the latest research backs it up \u2014 so keep washing your hands and disinfecting your home.\n\nThe graphic cites an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17. Researchers tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard.\n\n\"SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),\" the authors wrote. \"SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.\"\n\nAside from air, the worst surface for the virus is copper; researchers could only detect viable virus particles there for up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel \u2014 up to three days.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the article is not a peer-reviewed study, and researchers tested the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting. But their findings reflect what others have found about the potential longevity of the coronavirus outside the body.\n\nAn article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about how long human coronaviruses can survive on different surfaces. The authors found that viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19, could live for a couple of days on steel, plastic, wood, paper and glass surfaces.\n\nWhat about money, which many Americans handle every day? The World Health Organization advises people to wash their hands with soap and water after handling banknotes, coins and credit cards.\n\nThe Journal of Hospital Infection article says human coronaviruses could live on paper for anywhere between one to five days. The U.S. Dollar is made up of 75% cotton and 25% linen, as opposed to wood pulp, which is the base for most paper.\n\nStill, you\u2019re probably safer handling coins. The New England Journal of Medicine article found that COVID-19 can only survive for up to four hours on copper, which is what quarters, nickels and dimes are primarily made of. Ironically, pennies are made primarily of zinc, although they have a copper exterior.\n\nBased on the information available, KIRO-TV\u2019s infographic is accurate.

White House officials have repeatedly said it\u2019s not something they\u2019re considering at this time.\n\nIn the past few days, several state and local governments have taken drastic action to try to contain the spread of the 2019 coronavirus.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced March 19 a statewide \"shelter in place\" order. On March 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all nonessential businesses to keep their employees home. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has ordered all restaurants to close except for takeout and delivery.\n\nOne popular chain message takes these measures a step further.\n\n\"Homeland security is preparing to mobilize the national guard. Preparing to dispatch them across the US with military,\" reads the message, which claims it was sent by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. \"They will also call in 1st responders. They are preparing to announce a nationwide 2 week quarantine for all citizens, All businesses closed.\"\n\n(Screenshot from iMessage)\n\nA reader sent us the message on March 19. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted a screenshot of a very similar text on March 20.\n\n\"Here we go again with the \u2018my friend whose dad works in the government\u2019 rumors,\" he said.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen several other chain messages that falsely claim the federal government is set to announce a nationwide quarantine to stem the spread of COVID-19. So we checked this one out, too.\n\nThe text contains kernels of truth, but its primary message is bogus.\n\nThere is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a lockdown like the ones seen in France, Italy and Spain. While the National Guard and the military have been dispatched to some areas of the country hard-hit by the coronavirus, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor FEMA have ordered them to. And the message misinterprets the Stafford Act, a federal disaster relief law that activates FEMA and sends aid to state and local governments.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly said he is not considering a nationwide quarantine or curfew. He first answered a question about it during a March 16 press conference and reiterated his point in another briefing the following day.\n\n\"It\u2019s a very big step. It\u2019s something we talk about, but we haven\u2019t decided to do that,\" he said.\n\nMore recently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned misinformation about lockdowns during a March 20 press conference.\n\n\"Just urge everyone as they\u2019re seeing information \u2014 information that at one time suggested that somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army, information about lockdowns that are taking place \u2014 every American, indeed people all around the world, should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong,\" he said.\n\nRELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nOne of the first places where officials did mandate a lockdown is New Rochelle, N.Y., where Cuomo ordered a one-mile containment zone on March 10. Large gathering spots were closed for 14 days and National Guard troops are delivering food to people at the request of the state.\n\nIn California, nonessential businesses \u2014 such as bars, dine-in restaurants and gyms \u2014 are closed as part of the statewide lockdown. The state has also asked the U.S. Navy for a hospital ship and two mobile hospitals to help treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nState and local governments retain the power to quarantine Americans within their own borders. On the federal level, the Department of Homeland Security can screen and quarantine individuals reentering the U.S. from other countries. But forced quarantines are historically rare, and most infected people are allowed to self-quarantine.\n\nAs for the Stafford Act, Trump invoked the law March 13, thereby authorizing aid for state and local governments grappling with the coronavirus and waiving certain regulations that impede access to health care. The Stafford Act is commonly used during hurricanes and does not necessitate a nationwide lockdown.\n\nThe chain message is inaccurate.

We want to be ready, early, for the next one. Because clearly, the Obama administration did not leave any kind of game plan for something like this,\" said McConnell.\n\nThis claim caught our attention because its definitive nature was directly at odds with the position of some former Obama administration officials, who immediately disputed it and started circulating on social media the link to such a plan.\n\nWe reached out to McConnell\u2019s press team to ask for the basis of his statement. McConnell\u2019s spokesperson David Popp said in an emailed response that \"this is a unique crisis and we are all adapting to the public health and economic challenges.\" In terms of the pandemic\u2019s economic impact, he said there was \"definitely no playbook there\" and instead credited McConnell with his work on the CARES act, a coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress.\n\nThe pandemic playbook\n\nSoon after McConnell made his playbook comment, Ronald Klain, who was the White House Ebola response coordinator from October 2014 to February 2015, tweeted out a link to a document titled \"Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.\"\n\nThe document, originally unearthed in March by Politico, is a 69-page National Security Council guidebook developed in 2016 with the goal of assisting leaders \"in coordinating a complex U.S. Government response to a high-consequence emerging disease threat anywhere in the world.\" It outlined questions to ask, who should be asked to get the answers and what key decisions should be made.\n\nNicole Lurie, another Obama administration official, confirmed to us the existence of the NSC pandemic playbook and also said similar documents were created for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"To say there was no playbook was ridiculous,\" said Lurie, who served as the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS during both terms of the Obama administration.\n\nThe playbook lists types of infectious disease threats that could emerge. \"Novel coronaviruses\" were among pathogens flagged as having potential to cause heightened concern.\n\nLurie said that there were tabletop exercises, which included planning for a pandemic-like situation, during the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. (The Trump administration also conducted an exercise \u2014 known as \"Crimson Contagion\" \u2014 in 2019.)\n\nOther Obama-era officials offered similar stories in interviews this week with CNN:\n\n\"They were extensively briefed, to the extent that they paid attention to these things during the transition,\" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who directed USAID\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance.\n\n\"We absolutely did leave a plan. It was called a playbook,\" said Lisa Monaco, who was a former homeland security adviser to President Obama The goal, she said, was to share the lessons learned during Ebola and Zika.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Loge, who served as a senior adviser within Obama\u2019s Food and Drug Administration, told KHN he remembered a very clear message from the HHS secretary regarding the presidential transition.\n\n\"Our job was to set up the Trump political staff for success, and we took that mandate very seriously,\" said Loge. He and his colleagues wrote memos to inform the Trump staff about priority issues. \"But nobody called me and asked what I was doing in my job,\" said Loge.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has maintained that the coronavirus sneaked up on the U.S., and Trump himself has even said it was a \"very unforeseen thing.\"\n\nBut, in a May 14 exchange with reporters on the White House lawn, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany acknowledged the existence of the Obama pandemic playbook, even holding it up to show the press. She also dismissed its usefulness.\n\n\"The Obama-Biden plan that has been referenced was insufficient. It wasn\u2019t going to work. What our administration did under the leadership of President Trump was do an entire 2018 pandemic preparedness report,\" said McEnany. Trump, who was standing nearby, agreed.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Obama administration did not leave behind a \"game plan\" for a pandemic.\n\nThat\u2019s wrong.\n\nMultiple Obama-era officials have said they left a 2016 \"pandemic playbook\" that detailed exact steps to take in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. The White House press secretary even held up the actual document on the White House lawn.\n\nThere has been discussion in recent days as to whether the Obama plan was dated because it dealt with lessons learned from earlier outbreaks that may not apply to the current pandemic. Still, McConnell\u2019s statement focused only on whether any such \"game plan\" existed, and ample evidence suggests it did.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nUPDATE, May 15, 2020: In a Fox News interview, McConnell acknowledged that he was incorrect in his assertion that the Obama administration didn\u2019t leave behind any kind of \"game plan\" regarding a pandemic threat. \"I was wrong.

It doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nWe have looked at what Fauci has said at different points during the pandemic, and his guidance has changed. The question is: Why?\n\nTop government agencies such as the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted their policies on masks based on new findings about the novel coronavirus. It wasn\u2019t until April 3 that the CDC urged everyone to wear one.\n\nBefore then, the message on masks was primarily about preserving a limited supply for health care workers, who were at especially high risk of exposure.\n\nWhat Fauci said in March interviews\n\nRubio\u2019s tweet specifically referred to what Fauci said in March. That month, Fauci gave two high-profile interviews. In the first one, which occurred days before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Fauci pushed back against the idea of everyone in the U.S. needing to wear masks.\n\nIt is worth reading Fauci\u2019s exact words from his March 8 interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes.\":\n\nFAUCI: The masks are important for someone who's infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now, when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, whatever, and everybody's wearing a mask. Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.\n\nHOST: You're sure of this, because people are listening really closely to this.\n\nFAUCI: Right. Now people should not be walk\u2014 there's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.\n\nAnd often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.\n\nHOST: And you can get some schmutz sort of staying inside there.\n\nFAUCI: Of course, but when you think \"masks,\" you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people \u2014 when you look at the films of countries, and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not against it. If you want to do it, that's fine.\n\nHOST: But it can lead to a shortage.\n\nFAUCI: Exactly, that\u2019s the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.\n\nFauci\u2019s critics have focused on his words \"there's no reason to be walking around with a mask.\" But in the same interview, he also said that it was \"fine\" to wear a mask, although it wouldn\u2019t offer perfect protection. And he said the main point was to preserve masks for those who were already ill and people providing care.\n\nOn March 27, Fauci spoke to a San Francisco NBC affiliate. He said given the shortage of masks, the general public ranked last behind doctors and nurses, and people who are infected.\n\n\"When we say you don't need to wear a mask, what we're really saying is make sure you prioritize it first for the people who need the mask,\" Fauci said. \"In a perfect world, if you had all the masks you wanted, then you could get some degree of protection, but make sure you prioritize it well.\"\n\nGuidance changed over the course of the month\n\nMarch was a pivotal month for understanding the disease. On March 1, the country had seen eight deaths. On March 31, the figure stood at more than 4,300.\n\nWhen public officials talked about masks, they were talking about high-quality, hospital grade masks. In February and March, when the spread of the virus was still limited in the U.S., the mask shortage was a top concern.\n\nOn March 2, the FDA and CDC were saying \"There is no added health benefit to the general American public to wear a respiratory protective device, such as an N95 respirator. The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.\"\n\nOn an emergency basis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration relaxed the rules on the sort of masks hospitals could use, citing tight supplies of the high-grade masks.\n\nThe shortage was nationwide, and became more acute as the virus spread. On March 23, a bipartisan group of physician lawmakers in Utah called on businesses to donate N95 masks for use by health workers.\n\nOn March 29, President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force briefed the press on steps underway to increase the supply of masks to doctors, nurses and all care providers.\n\nBy this time, COVID-19s had spread widely across the country, and public-health officials were rethinking their guidance as they learned more about the transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers.\n\nOn April 3, Trump announced, \"From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.\n\n\"In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,\" Trump said. \"I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard.\"\n\nWe reached out to Rubio\u2019s office and did not get a formal response, but his deputy chief of staff posted a non-responsive tweet.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said that Fauci lied about masks in March. This is incorrect in several ways.\n\nFauci did say, \"there is no reason to be walking around with a mask,\" but to call that lying takes Fauci\u2019s words out of context. The country faced a shortage of high-quality masks, and Fauci also said in his interviews that masks should be preserved for sick people and health care workers.\n\nIn addition, researchers did not know at the time that people without symptoms were spreading the virus. Once that was understood, wearing masks \u2014 even simple cloth masks \u2014 took on new importance for preventing community transmission.\n\nLying means there was an intent to deceive. Fauci\u2019s words in March about masks mirrored the widely held belief across government agencies at that time about the nature of the novel coronavirus and the best ways to control it.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nRELATED: Lies infected America in 2020.

But he never slashed the programs Behar was referring to, however.\n\nAs the Washington Post noted, there were concerns among global-health leaders that U.S. funding for an initiative known as the Global Health Security Agenda was running out, and that some U.S.-run pandemic-prevention programs would have to be downsized as a result.\n\nBut the Trump administration never pulled the plug on those programs, although it did propose smaller budgets. Congress has injected more money into them in recent budget requests.\n\nOne day after we reached out to ABC for comment, Behar made a tongue-in-cheek correction on air.\n\n\"The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries,\" Behar said. \"I\u2019m happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isn\u2019t that good?\"\n\nWhy the CDC thought its programs had to shrink\n\nThe CDC has been operating public-health programs in a number of foreign countries as part the Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States helped launch in 2014.\n\nThe initiative \u2014 which now includes 67 countries \u2014 is a global effort to help countries reduce the risk of infectious diseases.\n\nThe bulk of its early funding came from a one-time, five-year emergency spending bill that Congress approved in late 2014 to respond to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC \"to support national public health institutes and global health security.\"\n\nThe CDC had hoped those funds would be replenished once the five-year supplement expired in October 2019, according to reports. But as the expiration date approached, it looked like the agency could be left with just the core annual budget to pull from.\n\nNational news outlets reported in the spring of 2018 that the CDC was bracing for a possible funding drop-off. The CDC planned to scale back operations in 39 of 49 countries and focus on 10 \"priority countries,\" according to emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn the end, however, Congress provided enough funding to sustain the programs, experts told us. (The White House and CDC did not respond to our requests for comment. The CDC told Factcheck.org it \"did not have to cut back its work\" to 10 countries.)\n\n\"The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives,\" added Claire Standley, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Science and Security. \"In the end, that didn't happen.\"\n\nThe worry in early 2018 was that the budget for the CDC\u2019s global disease-prevention programs would be just over $50 million, as it had been in past years, when the supplement from 2014 was still the primary funding source. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal put it in that ballpark.\n\nBut the budget Congress ultimately passed bumped the appropriations for \"global disease detection and other programs\" up to $108.2 million. The same amount was provided in 2019.\n\nIn November 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services pledged an additional $150 million \"to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world\" at a meeting in which the U.S. affirmed its commitment to the next phase of the Global Health Security Agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2021 budget request appropriated $225 million for the same global-health programs, up from $183.2 million in 2020.\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported, Trump has consistently proposed cuts to certain CDC budgets, but the bills Congress ultimately passed \u2014 with Trump\u2019s signature \u2014 have steadily increased funding for the CDC\u2019s infectious-disease activities.\n\nExperts said the administration\u2019s wavering support has likely made it difficult for the CDC to plan out its activities.\n\n\"I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate,\" Standley said. \"But I do think that the Trump administration, in failing to provide consistent funding and clear indication of the priority placed on global health security capacity building, has made it difficult for the CDC to sustain the programs and successful efforts put into place since 2014.\"\n\n\"Programs weren\u2019t shut down in the end, but you can also say that the administration didn\u2019t prioritize them in the proposed budget,\" added Jennifer Nuzzi, an associate professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nA problem with the numbers\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Behar referred to a shutdown of 37 of 47 programs when the 2018 news reports said the CDC was considering scaling back 39 of 49 operations.\n\nIt\u2019s possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump \"shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs\" was debunked by other fact-checkers. But however you crunch the numbers, it\u2019s hard to get to 47 countries \u2014 or 49, for that matter.\n\nTrump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.\n\n\n\nHe is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics.\n\n\n\nHe shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs.\n\n\n\nTrump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 25, 2020\n\nA 2019 annual report on the Global Health Security Agenda says the CDC provides financial support and technical assistance to 17 priority countries, plus technical assistance for 14 countries and CARICOM, a group of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies.\n\nOne CARICOM country is Haiti, which is already listed among the countries receiving technical assistance from the CDC. Another is Montserrat, a British territory.\n\nThat adds up to 44 total countries, or 50 if you include six other countries that Standley said received some early support specifically related to the Ebola outbreak.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBehar said Obama \"set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus\" and \"Trump closed 37 of them.\"\n\nNews reports in 2018 said the CDC was planning to shrink its operations to help foreign countries prevent infectious diseases because it didn\u2019t expect to receive new funding once the supplement it received in 2014 ran out.

Though polling places attempted to institute social distancing, voters said it was impossible to maintain at all times, particularly in Milwaukee and Green Bay where masses of voters were shuttled through just a handful of locations.\n\nA few people have tried to answer this question in the time since, including an April 17, 2020, article shared widely on Facebook. The story claimed \"immense consequences\" from in-person voting, with this headline:\n\n\"New Virus Cases Surge in Wisconsin a Week After Republicans Forced In-Person Election to Go Forward.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nHave confirmed coronavirus cases really surged after the in-person election?\n\nNo, they haven\u2019t. At least not yet. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nClaim based on flawed data work\n\nThe article, posted by the website Second Nexus, pulled its sole statistical evidence from a tweet by Topher Spiro, a health policy analyst with more than 100,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nHe posted a chart showing a dip in the number of positive cases on April 13, followed by increases each of the next three days. The accompanying text said, \"Check out the uptick in transmission the GOP caused by forcing an in-person election in Wisconsin.\"\n\nPeople who contract COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, typically don\u2019t start showing symptoms for about five days. A study of 181 cases in China found the median incubation period \u2014 time before symptoms show \u2014 was five days, and only 1% first showed symptoms after 14 days (hence the standard 14-day quarantine).\n\nSpiro and the Second Nexus story are starting with a point a week after the April 7 election and saying the increase in new cases is connected.\n\nBut there are several critical data errors here.\n\nFirst, calling the post-April 13 increase a trend assumes that April 13 is a valid baseline. If the state had been at the April 13 level for some time, then an increase from that level could be proof of a new trend.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nApril 13 was a very unusual day for coronavirus testing. The state administered an average of 1,600 coronavirus tests daily in the first three weeks of April. But on April 13 it administered only 940 \u2014 400 less than any other day.\n\nPredictably, with fewer tests came fewer positive results, and a large dip in the number of new confirmed cases.\n\nThe rise in the days after \u2014 identified by the story as proof of the election impact \u2014 was actually just a result of the number of tests growing to 1,355, then 1,495, then 1,802 the four days after April 13. Before and after that date, the percentage of tests that came back positive remained about the same: between 9% and 10%\n\nWhen presented with this data, Spiro deleted his tweet.\n\n\"It looks like testing has increased since April 13 and the positive rate has remained roughly constant,\" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nWhat\u2019s really happening\n\nThe truth is, at the time of the Second Nexus article \u2014 and this one \u2014 it\u2019s too soon to say what impact the election had on Wisconsin\u2019s coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut so far there is no sign of an increase, said Andrea Palm, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. In the state\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing on April 20, 2020, she also noted the time between contracting the disease and being a confirmed case involves more than just the five-day median incubation time.\n\n\"I think folks do need to remember sort of the progression of this virus, from infection to symptoms to the conversation with your physician to the test to the test results,\" Palm said. \"It\u2019s not surprising that we have not seen \u2026 a large uptick from in-person voting.\"\n\nRELATED: Tracking coronavirus in Wisconsin\n\nIf we look closer at the data before and after April 13, we see the state has so far seen no change in the frequency of new cases.\n\nThe state averaged 153 new cases per day the week before April 13, and 153 the week after. The percentage of tests coming back positive remained relatively consistent throughout that span.\n\nAnd the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 actually dropped, from 431 on April 13 to about 360 every day from April 17-20.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the election had no impact. There have been reports of infection potentially linked to the election.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported April 20 that seven people appear to have contracted COVID-19 through activities related to the April 7 election. Six are voters, and one is a poll worker.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say if there will be more, or if they in turn infected others. We don\u2019t even know for sure that polling places are where those seven were infected.\n\nBut that certainly doesn\u2019t constitute a \"surge.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn article shared widely on Facebook claimed on April 17, 2020, that Wisconsin coronavirus cases had surged as a result of the in-person election.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days\u2019 new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days.\n\nWe don\u2019t know for sure what impact the election may prove to have, but we do know it\u2019s wrong to say a surge has already surfaced.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "date": "2020/04/17", "false_statement": " Says Wisconsin\u2019s in-person election has caused a \u201csurge\u201d in new coronavirus cases\t\t", "true_statement": " The claimed surge in cases was based on poor data work.

It\u2019s a unique datapoint as politicians and citizens alike argue over how and when to re-open.\n\nAnd one TV outlet says you\u2019re being lied to about it.\n\nOn the One America News Network, host Liz Wheeler described it this way in a May 8, 2020, clip labeled online as \"What the (mainstream media) was afraid to tell you\":\n\n\"There is no evidence to date that there was a surge of infections due to the April 7, 2020, election in Wisconsin. \u2026 But did the mainstream media report on this?

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWheeler is right about there being no evidence of a surge. We\u2019ve repeatedly debunked claims that there was one.\n\nBut her generalization about \"mainstream media\" claiming otherwise? That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how this topic has been covered by prominent media outlets.\n\nState, national reports measured in discussing election impact\n\nFor starters, let\u2019s be clear that there was no election \"surge.\"\n\nAs of May 11, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services identified 71 people who tested positive for COVID-19 after voting or working the polls in the April 7 election, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt. The important caveat here is that it\u2019s impossible to say how many were infected at the polls since some reported other possible exposures.\n\nThe 71 tally runs from April 9 to 21, when the two-week incubation period for the coronavirus would have ended. There were 1,864 positive tests in that span in Wisconsin, so the cases known to intersect with election activity accounted for less than 4% of that total.\n\nNow on to the \"mainstream media\" reports.\n\nWheeler\u2019s report cites no sources for the claim the media said there was a surge in cases, so we cast a wide net looking at news coverage ourselves.\n\nCNN \u2014 a favorite target for far-right claims of media bias \u2014 reported on April 22 about what was then 19 cases in people who voted or worked the polls. The third and fourth paragraphs of the story detail the caveat that those people had other exposures, so it\u2019s impossible to say the election was the source.\n\nABC News published a similar report April 21, prominently noting the same caveat in the second paragraph.\n\nThe Associated Press, reporting on updated data April 29, said 50 people connected to the election had tested positive. It noted the origin caveat in the second paragraph. Like the CNN and ABC reports the week before, it contained no hyperbolic language calling this a surge or anything close to that.\n\nIn-state sources were even more clear.\n\nAn April 22 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story was headlined, \"Two weeks after election, COVID-19 cases have not spiked in Wisconsin but experts urge caution about conclusions.\"\n\nA Wisconsin State Journal report on April 23 worked the \"can\u2019t say for certain\" caveat into the lead sentence. It did the same for a May 8 story when the tally had grown to 67.\n\nAnd a fact-check published by both PolitiFact Wisconsin and USA TODAY rated False a claim from a little-known news outlet that there had been a \"surge\" in COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin after the election. Here\u2019s what that fact check said about the sloppily-reported claim from SecondNexus.com:\n\n\"The data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days\u2019 new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days.\"\n\nBoth the article and the tweet it was based on were removed after that fact-check published.\n\nWe won\u2019t bother to dive deeper into Wheeler\u2019s \"pretended\" claim. That adds another layer of absurdity since it implies some kind of intentional coverup or falsehood, when there\u2019s no proof the coverage was wrong in the first place.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe One America News Network claimed in a video posted to Facebook that \"mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting.\"\n\nWe didn\u2019t find a single traditional or \"mainstream\" news outlet that characterized the election-related cases as a surge or anything close to that \u2014 much less anything that would support this kind of sweeping generalization.\n\nThe reports prominently noted the caveat that officials can\u2019t say for certain that the election caused the cases we are aware of, and they had made no exaggerated claims about how large those numbers were. (And, to be clear, the 71 cases certainly don\u2019t constitute a surge.)\n\nSo Wheeler is flat wrong in both her claim about coverage and the related implication from the use of \"pretended\" that something was reported wrong intentionally.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "date": "2020/05/08", "false_statement": " \u201cThe mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " No, the media did not \u201cpretend there was a deadly surge inCOVID-19cases\u201d after Wisconsin election. This news broadcast gave no evidence of its claim about errant mainstream media reporting. Our review of state and national articles about the election found no references to a \u201csurge\u201d or anything close to that. Reports accurately listed the number of cases potentially related to the election and the caveat that we can\u2019t know the origin of those cases for sure. The conspiracy implied by the use of \u201cpretended\u201d makes this even more ridiculous, since there isn\u2019t proof any reporting was wrong in the first place."}

However, it was a planning exercise and did not predict the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA Facebook video that racked up thousands of shares claims the coronavirus now spreading across the world was planned and released by the United States government \u2014 and it says that this claim is backed up by \"Alexa,\" the voice of the Amazon Echo.\n\nEcho is a voice-activated home speaker that can provide the user with answers to questions and other content by searching the internet for information. Echo users connect with the device by conversing with \"Alexa,\" the system\u2019s \"virtual assistant.\"\n\nThe March 31 video is a recording of a TikTok video playing on another smartphone. The man recording the Facebook video warns viewers of his fears that the TikTok video will be deleted from the platform. In the TikTok, a man asks his Amazon Echo, \"Alexa, did the government release the coronavirus?\"\n\nIn the video, Alexa\u2019s computer-generated voice responds: \"According to Event 201, the government planned this event, created the virus and had a simulation of how the countries would react. This simulation occurred October 18, 2019. The government released the virus among the population and has lost control of the outbreak.\"\n\nThe spread of misinformation about the coronavirus on TikTok and through Amazon Alexa have recently been reported by outlets such as WUSA9\u2019s VERIFY team and Vox. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nWhat is Event 201?\n\nThere was an Event 201, involving a simulated viral pandemic. And it did take place on Oct. 18, 2019, at a hotel in New York. But no actual virus was created or released.\n\nDuring the event, officials from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and 15 global business, government and public health leaders held a 3.5 hour simulation to view the potential effects of an infectious pandemic.\n\nThe exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live \"staff\" briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics, the organizers said.\n\nThe purpose of the simulation was to examine how industries, governments and public health leaders might have to join forces to combat a global health crisis. It was inspired by research published by the World Economic Forum, an international foundation that studies the intersection of business, politics and academics and their impacts on policy.\n\nThe pandemic in the fictionalized scenario was caused by a coronavirus, of which there are many types.\n\nThe study found that a pandemic could cause an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global gross domestic product, or about $570 billion. The businesses and political leaders involved in the simulation were tasked with working together to create viable solutions to the theoretical pandemic.\n\nThe participants\u2019 conclusion was that \"the next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering.\"\n\nNow that the world is grappling with an actual coronavirus pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has released a statement reaffirming that the simulation did not predict the current outbreak, but rather was an exercise to examine what would need to happen if one did occur.\n\n\"For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,\" the center said. \"Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic.\"\n\nAlexa\u2019s Response\n\nWhy did the question posed to Alexa bring up Event 201?\n\nThat only happens in the TikTok video. We asked Alexa directly, and it brought up a different response.\n\nAlexa said, \"According to the World Health Organization, the exact cause of the current outbreak of COVID-19 is still under investigation. On December 31, 2019, it was reported to the WHO country office in China that a new coronavirus strain later, named COVID-19, was identified by Chinese researchers in connection with a pneumonia-like illness based in Wuhan city, China.\"\n\nA spokesperson at Amazon told PolitiFact that the one appearing in the video \"is not Alexa's response to customers, and we have not been able to replicate this example.\"\n\nThe company said that any news Alexa is providing to customers about COVID-19 is from official government sources.\n\nThe company suggested a couple of explanations why Alexa might have responded the way it did in the video.\n\nOne possibility is that a customer set a specific response for Alexa. Responses can be recorded and scheduled, like a daily reminder service. This response would play only on that customer\u2019s device, not the system at large.\n\nAnother possibility involves Alexa Skill Blueprints, which offer templates for trivia games, birthday cards, and flashcards. With this feature, users can create their own automated questions and responses.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nFacebook posts say that if you ask Amazon\u2019s Alexa about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, it says \"the government planned\" it and refers to something called \"Event 201.\"\n\nThere was a project called Event 201 that simulated possible outcomes of a coronavirus pandemic, but it was a planning exercise and did not predict this specific COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore importantly, we were unable to elicit the same answer from Alexa, and Amazon told us that the answer to that question would be different.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "date": "2020/03/31", "false_statement": " If you ask Amazon\u2019s Alexa about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, it says \u201cthe government planned\u201d it.\t\t", "true_statement": " The Alexa answer in the post refers to a real project called Event 201 that simulated possible outcomes of a coronavirus pandemic.

The post was withdrawn.\n\nVirus testing in Georgia, drawn from the Covid Testing Project data, shows there was a smaller increase in the number of new cases in the period after Gov. Brian Kemp relaxed restrictions than in a similar period before the change.\n\nUnder Kemp, Georgia was one of the first states to reopen businesses.\n\nBetween April 24 and April 27, restaurants, gyms, beauty parlors and a number of other kinds of businesses began to welcome customers, so long as they followed rules to keep patrons separated and took other measures to prevent infection.\n\nIn the 12 days before April 24, when Kemp began easing restrictions, Georgia had a total of 9,695 confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nIn the 12 days after (which coincides with Abrams\u2019 interview), Georgia reported about 1,100 fewer confirmed cases, 8,549.\n\nOverall, comparing the two time periods, cases in Georgia decreased 12% after the reopening. They didn\u2019t increase 40%.\n\nBringman said no one has firm numbers in Georgia.\n\n\"The state is not producing accurate data, thus there is no way to know how many Georgians who have suffered,\" he said.\n\nThe state has had problems, particularly in tracking deaths at long-term care facilities.\n\nBut without good data, Abrams also wouldn\u2019t have any basis to say cases rose 40%.\n\nWhen she spoke, it was way too early to know if relaxing the rules on business had caused the disease to spread.\n\nIt takes anywhere from three to 14 days for an infection to take hold. And after that, more days before a person feels ill enough to see a doctor, get tested and get test results back.\n\nBoston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray emphasized that the impact of reopening business life in Georgia won\u2019t be clear for some time.\n\n\"There could be up to a month or more delay between when a case is reported and when the infection was transmitted,\" Murray said. \"This makes it very difficult to say whether cases are from before or after opening, especially in the first few weeks.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAbrams said that after Georgia\u2019s governor reopened certain business activities, the COVID-19 rate rose 40%.\n\nIn reality, the period after reopening had 12% fewer cases.

No one saw this coming.\n\n\"It snuck up on us,\" Trump said at a March 18 media briefing. Later, he added that the virus is \"a very unforeseen thing.\"\n\nTrump has repeated that idea a lot lately. But the claim doesn\u2019t square with the evidence.\n\nPublic health researchers have been warning for years about the threat of a pandemic. And members of his administration have been sounding the alarm for months now \u2013 even while, just earlier this month, Trump was still comparing the virus\u2019 severity to the flu, and arguing that it \"will go away\" if people \"stay calm.\"\n\nWe contacted the White House, which declined to comment on the record. Meanwhile, independent experts told us this claim is deeply misleading.\n\nThe coronavirus itself\n\nBoth in Washington and internationally, health officials had been warning about the dangers posed by COVID-19 since at least January, with some early signals going back as far as December when the illness emerged in the Wuhan province of China. Those warnings continued into February, well before the White House began taking serious steps to increase testing and treatment efforts \u2013 a delay that experts said has significantly undermined the national response.\n\nIndeed, by mid January, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told the president that the virus \u2013 which had already spread through China \u2013 could pose a threat domestically, too, according to reporting by The New York Times, Washington Post and Politico.\n\nThen, by the end of the month, Azar had declared it a \"public health emergency\" in the United States. According to the Times report, Dr. Robert Redfield, who heads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had also by that point realized \"that it had a great ability to go global.\"\n\n\"The alarm was sounded in January,\" said Jennifer Kates, a global health expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This wasn\u2019t a surprise.\" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nAt that point, researchers told us, decisive and widespread federal action could have made a big difference.\n\nBut publicly, Trump was still comparing the virus to the flu, downplaying the risk on Twitter and television, and declaring repeatedly that the virus was under control.\n\nWarnings from others continued. On Feb. 25, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who runs CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, also highlighted the risk the virus would pose.\n\nAnd of course, the coronavirus warnings didn\u2019t just come from Washington.\n\nOn Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared the virus a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern,\" citing its rapid spread since December, when it first emerged in China.\n\nIn doing so, \"we were alerting all countries of very real threat of international spread,\" said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBy Feb. 24, WHO had told reporters that the virus had a real risk of becoming a global pandemic, and warned that all countries should be prepared.\n\nThe weeks-long gaps between those warnings and federal efforts to actually test for coronavirus, and to treat it, matter greatly, Kates said.\n\n\"It was very visible what was happening and what measures we should be taking,\" she told us.\n\nHad the White House acted earlier, in particular by stepping up efforts to test for the virus and isolate cases immediately, the virus may not have spread as quickly, global health experts said. The ongoing efforts to \"socially distance\" even people without symptoms \u2013 which have large economic and health downsides, are less effective and less enforceable, researchers told us \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be as necessary as they are now.\n\n\"Delays of days here matter. When we start throwing away weeks, we really change what\u2019s possible,\" said Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University. \"If we had done a little more of anything, we would find ourselves in a better situation than where we are right now.\"\n\nPandemic preparedness\n\nMeanwhile, people in public health and national security had been warning for years about a looming pandemic \u2013 and noting that the United States wasn\u2019t adequately prepared for the devastation it could wreak on both citizens\u2019 health and the economy.\n\nThe only details missing were what pandemic and when precisely it would strike.\n\n\"Public health experts have been shouting that a major pandemic is likely and, in fact, is the greatest security threat we face,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University who studies public health law.\n\nAs for claims that something like COVID-19 \"snuck up on us\" or was \"very unforeseen\"?\n\n\"It is simply astonishing and simply untrue,\" he said.\n\nResearchers pointed us to countless reports \u2013 including some by government officials \u2013 that highlighted the threat of a pandemic.\n\nIn May 2018, researchers at Johns Hopkins University put out a paper warning that respiratory viruses posed a \"global catastrophic biological risk.\" In particular, the researchers warned about RNA viruses -- viruses made up of the traditionally single-stranded ribonucleic acid, and also cause illnesses such as the common cold, influenza, hepatitis C and polio.\n\nTheir warning wasn\u2019t off: COVID-19 is indeed a respiratory illness caused by an RNA virus, from the same specific viral family -- that is, the coronavirus family -- as SARS and MERS.\n\nThen, in October 2019, the World Economic Forum, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted an event to discuss how public and private interests would have to respond in the event of a pandemic. That was only one of many such \"simulations\" run by health experts concerned about how the U.S. would respond to a looming pandemic threat.\n\n\"Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global\u2014a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,\" read the event description.\n\nAnd months later, in Jan. 2019 \u2013 more than a year before the president\u2019s advisers sounded the coronavirus alarm \u2013 the topic of a global pandemic emerged again, in a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\"We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,\" reads the report.\n\nIn fact, the report suggested animal-to-human transmission as a source for the next major pandemic \u2013 which, experts say, is in fact how COVID-19 emerged.\n\nAnd, finally, reporting from Politico shows that, when Trump entered office, members of the Obama administration warned about the threat of a looming viral pandemic \u2013 and noted that, if it occurred, the nation didn\u2019t have the medical resources to handle it.\n\n\"Many people saw this coming, although, of course, it was not known exactly when,\" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nPut another way: Experts have been talking about the need for pandemic preparedness, Mores recalled, for at least as long as he has been studying global health. He\u2019s been in the field for 25 years.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPresident Donald Trump said COVID-19 \"snuck up on us,\" and was \"a very unforeseen thing.\"\n\nIn fact, the president heard warnings about this specific virus from his advisers and the global health community for months. And public health and national security experts had been highlighting the risks for even longer about the threat of some kind of pandemic \u2013 even if the details weren\u2019t yet known.\n\nIndeed, it is because of Trump\u2019s slow response to the pandemic that \"social distancing\" is now required at such a large-scale level. Earlier, more focused testing and sequestering of people with the virus could have mitigated some of the response now required, experts told us.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is incorrect, and in fact flies in the face of years\u2019 worth of evidence.

It says the 2019 coronavirus is a human betacoronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and likely comes from bats.\n\n\"Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans,\" the study reads.\n\nEarly reports on the virus focused on the fact that many patients were linked to the Wuhan market. That suggested animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC, but later, a growing number of patients reported not having any connection to the market. That suggested the coronavirus was spreading person-to-person.\n\nOther blogs and social media users have speculated that a lab near Wuhan could be the source of the virus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and SARS.

Bobby Scott, D-Va., recently criticized President Donald Trump for not taking the Covid-19 pandemic \"seriously.\"\n\nAs proof, Scott cited the critical lack of test kits in the United States despite almost two months of warnings early this year before the disease hit American shores.\n\n\"If you line up all the countries that have done testing on a per capita basis, we\u2019re at the bottom of the list,\" Scott said during an April 2 radio interview on the conservative John Fredericks Show based in Portsmouth.\n\nGovernors from both parties and health-care experts have complained that the lack of Covid-19 tests has hampered efforts to combat the disease. Trump has said things have picked up and the U.S. has now conducted more tests than any nation. PolitiFact has debunked a similar Trump claim, noting that the U.S. has a high population and it lags in the key comparison measurement - the number of conducted tests per capita.\n\nBut we wondered whether the U.S. really is at the bottom of nations in per capita testing, as Scott said. So we did a fact check.\n\nStatistical stew\n\nLet\u2019s start by emphasizing that global comparisons of Covid-19 testing are tenuous because nations measure it differently.\n\nOur World in Data, a research organization funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates, collects statistics from 50 nations and notes some countries count the total number of tests performed, others report the number of people tested, others tally the number of tests that have been analyzed. The organization says for many nations, it\u2019s unclear what method is used. The group says the varied reporting does not produce \"meaningful comparisons\" of nations.\n\nThe U.S. does not have a central source of statistics on testing, most of which is done by private labs. A widely-cited unofficial count comes from The Covid Tracking Project, a data set that journalists and scientists collect statistics from states and localities - which also have different ways of compiling numbers.\n\nScott\u2019s proof\n\nWe asked Scott\u2019s press office for the source of the congressman\u2019s claim that the U.S. ranks last among testing nations. We were sent a March 12, 2020 Vox article with a chart showing the U.S. had conducted only 23 Covid-19 tests per 1 million people. That was the fewest among eight comparison nations: Japan, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Israel, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea and the Guangdong Province of China.\n\nVox said it drew its statistics from a variety of sources, including the Covid Tracking Project. Even if we overlook the difficulties in comparing testing data, a huge problem remains: Scott was using March 12 figures to describe the situation on April 2 - the day of his interview.\n\nConditions change fast with the coronavirus. The U.S. had conducted 10,262 tests through March 12, according to Tracking Project estimates. By April 2, it was up to 1.3 million. On the day Scott made his statement, Vox put a note on its three-week-old article saying there had been \" significant developments in the coronavirus pandemic since this story was last updated, and details may no longer apply.\"\n\nAs of April 13, the project estimated the U.S. had run 2.9 million tests.\n\nVox no longer ranks the U.S. last in per capita testing. On April 13, it placed the U.S. fifth among nine nations: Italy, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Netherlands, U.K., France and Taiwan.\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said on April 2, \"If you line up all the countries that have done (Covid-19) testing on a per capita basis, we\u2019re at the bottom of the list.\"\n\nHis statement was based on an early-March estimate by Vox that was outdated when Scott spoke. U.S. testing had expanded 130-fold by April 2, and has doubled again in the last two weeks. Vox now estimates the U.S. is somewhere near the middle. Other, more expansive research notes that nations differ in how they collect data, preventing \"meaningful comparisons.\"\n\nThere\u2019s widespread agreement the U.S. got off to a slow start on testing and, despite gains, far greater testing is still essential. But the burden falls on Scott to prove his claim that the U.S. was last per capita in early April, and his evidence doesn\u2019t stand up.\n\nSo, we rate his statement False.", "date": "2020/04/02", "false_statement": " \u201dIf you line up all the countries that have done (COVID-19) testing on a per-capita basis, we\u2019re [the US] at the bottom of the list.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " His statement was based on an early-March estimate by Vox that was outdated when Scott spoke.

Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\"\n\nThe reference to \"Wuhan-400\" comes from the 1981 book \"The Eyes of Darkness\" by Dean Koontz. But Snopes, which fact-checked another claim that Koontz predicted the new coronavirus outbreak, pointed out several ways the current outbreak differs from what\u2019s described in the novel. In the book, for example, Wuhan-400 has a 100% fatality rate. But in China, where more than 77,600 cases have been confirmed, the death toll is 2,663.\n\nThe Facebook post we\u2019re checking similarly suggests that Browne\u2019s \"End of Days\" predicted the new coronavirus.

The potential vaccine was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and biotechnology company Moderna, Inc.\n\nRELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nIn a March 30 press release, the Department of Health and Human Services said it is accelerating clinical trials of that vaccine, as well as another potential COVID-19 vaccine from Janssen Research & Development. But the first phase of the latter trial is set to begin \"no later than fall of 2020 with the goal of making COVID-19 vaccine available for emergency use in the United States in early 2021,\" according to HHS.\n\nDuring his March 11 testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee on the coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, laid out a timeline for developing a COVID-19 vaccine. He said phase one will take about three months to determine if it\u2019s safe, then phase two, during which scientists will test whether the vaccine works, could take another eight months at least.\n\nHe cautioned that any process that moves faster than that could be dangerous.\n\n\"So when you\u2019ve heard me say we would not have a vaccine that would even be ready to start to deploy for a year to a year and a half, that is the time frame,\" Fauci told representatives. \"Now anyone who thinks that it will go more quickly than that I believe will be cutting corners that would be detrimental.\"\n\nPublic domain records show that some of the websites spreading the bogus articles about a new coronavirus vaccine are registered in Ghana and Nigeria.

CEOs and their companies don\u2019t always disclose the factors involved in leadership changes.\n\nThe post listed 14 companies. But only two had CEOs who stepped down from their posts, and left their companies, since the coronavirus first surfaced in China.\n\nIn late March, several senators faced angry questions about stock sales they made in the days following an intelligence briefing on the coronavirus, and before spreading panic over the virus pummeled U.S. markets. Now there are suspicions online that certain powerful people were tipped off to the threat of the coronavirus in time to protect their finances.\n\nOne Facebook post claims that after being tipped off by government officials, the chief executive officers of more than 14 major companies resigned in order to be able to sell stocks they owned.\n\nHere\u2019s the post:\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAmong those listed, we did find two examples of departing CEOs selling company stock, but that was after the outbreak was publicly known, and both were still with their companies. There\u2019s no evidence of any coordinated effort by government officials to give 14 CEOs advance information about the coronavirus that they could use for personal profit.\n\nReasons for resignations unclear\n\nCEOs can depart for any number of reasons, including normal succession planning, or moves by the board to shake up leadership. CEOs and companies don\u2019t always go public with all the reasons behind such departures.\n\n\"Just like politicians leaving to spend more time with their families, CEOs\u2019 actual reasons for departure are rarely described accurately,\" corporate-governance expert Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, told PolitiFact.\n\nA public company is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to explain a CEO\u2019s departure only if the CEO resigned because of a disagreement with the company over operations, policies or practices, or if the CEO was removed for cause, said Douglas Chia, president of Soundboard Governance, a corporate governance consulting firm, and a fellow at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for Corporate Law and Governance. Such rules are in place to protect investors\u2019 rights.\n\nTo deter insider trading, CEOs, other senior executives and board members are generally restricted from trading in their own company's stock, except during designated trading windows, Chia said. Those windows usually open in the two weeks immediately after the company\u2019s quarterly earnings report is released. The trades must be cleared with a company\u2019s legal department and reported within two days to the SEC, Chia said.\n\nOverview of the 14 companies cited\n\nThe COVID-19 disease can be traced back to Dec. 31, when the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. Eight days later, China identified it as a new type of coronavirus. The first coronavirus case in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21.\n\nWe found that of the 14 companies listed in the post, only two had corporate CEOs who resigned their posts \u2014 and actually left their companies \u2014 after the coronavirus surfaced in China.\n\nAnother two CEOs sold company stock after the outbreak. At the time of the sales, however, the outbreak was already publicly known, and the CEOs hadn\u2019t yet left their companies.\n\nWe found no evidence the CEOs received advance information about the coronavirus or that they left in order to be freed from regulations that restricted their ability to sell stock.\n\nThe 2 who left their companies\n\nOf the corporate CEOs alluded to in the Facebook post, two resigned between Dec. 31, 2019, and March 29, 2020, the date of the post \u2014 and left their companies:\n\nHarley-Davidson announced Feb. 28 that Matthew Levatich had stepped down as CEO and a director. The company\u2019s shares had fallen 46% since he took charge in May 2015.\n\nMGM Resorts announced Feb. 12 that Jim Murren had decided not to serve out his contract, which ran through the end of 2021, but that he would stay on until a successor was named.\n\nMGM\u2019s announcement, the earlier of the two, came two weeks after the Trump administration suspended entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days.\n\nOn Feb. 19 and 20, Murren sold more than $22 million of the company\u2019s common stock, at between $32.15 and $32.17 a share, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The sales were made public to the SEC.\n\nAbout a month later, MGM closed its Las Vegas casinos because of the coronavirus, and Murren acquired 6,000 shares of MGM restricted stock units. On the day Murren\u2019s purchase was disclosed, March 18, the stock price had dropped to $7.14.\n\nBut Murren was still CEO during both sets of stock transactions. He stepped down as CEO on March 22, the same day it was announced he would lead a state coronavirus task force formed by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak.\n\n5 out as CEO, but still with company\n\nFive CEOs stepped down from their positions, but were staying with their companies as executive chairman, a top leadership post that typically involves some day-to-day duties in addition to a seat on the board. Companies often say they want the former CEO to stay for a limited period of time to ensure a smooth transition to the new CEO, Chia said. CEOs who resigned but stayed on as executive chairman were still under restrictions for trading in their company\u2019s stock.\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s Robert Iger stepped down Feb. 25 after a 15-year tenure as CEO, but remained with Disney as executive chairman, the company said in a statement.\n\nLockheed Martin announced March 16 that Marillyn Hewson would be replaced effective June 15, but that she would remain as executive chairman. She sold $9.5 million in Lockheed stock on Jan. 29.\n\nIBM on Jan. 30 announced a new CEO to replace Virginia Rometty. But it said Rometty would continue as executive chairman and serve through the end of 2020, when she would retire after almost 40 years with the company.\n\nLinkedIn: announced Feb. 5 that Jeffrey Weiner \"decided to take on a new role as executive chairman.\" He won\u2019t step down as CEO until June 1.\n\nMastercard announced Feb. 25 that Ajay Banga would transition to the position of executive chairman on Jan. 1, 2021, and remain CEO until then.\n\n3 left before the outbreak\n\nThree of the CEOs cited on the list left their posts or announced their departures before the coronavirus outbreak surfaced.\n\neBay\u2019s Devin Wenig tweeted that his departure was because \"it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new Board.\" That was on Sept. 25, more than three months before the first report out of Wuhan.\n\nT-Mobile announced Nov. 18, 2019, that John Legere would depart on April 30.\n\nNissan announced Sept. 9 that Hiroto Saikawa had indicated he was willing to resign and the board asked him to resign, effective Sept. 16. His term was marked by controversy over the arrest of former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, turmoil with partner Renault SA and a sharp falloff in profits, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSeveral others don\u2019t fit the Facebook claim\n\nIn a few cases, the CEO departures were long-planned, or at a subsidiary level, not at the parent company. And one purported CEO resignation wasn\u2019t that at all.\n\nNestle CEO Mark Schneider is still in place. The post might have been referring to Fernando Merc\u00e9. He resigned Feb. 21 as president and CEO of Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, a subsidiary, \"due to personal reasons,\" the company told BevNET.\n\nHulu CEO Randy Freer was stepping down, The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 31, as new owner Walt Disney Co. integrates the streaming service more closely into its direct-to-consumer business. Freer\u2019s departure had been expected since Disney took over control of Hulu last May, The Verge reported.\n\nVolkswagen said Luca de Meo, the head of the automaker\u2019s Spanish brand, SEAT, resigned Jan. 7. He\u2019s becoming the new CEO of Renault. But Herbert Diess, CEO of the parent company, has been in place for two years.\n\nMicrosoft has had the same CEO, Satya Nadella, since 2014. The company announced March 13 that co-founder Bill Gates stepped down from the board to dedicate more time to his philanthropic activities, but would remain as a technology adviser to Nadella and others in the company.\n\nMinow said it\u2019s good that executives are required to disclose their personal sales of company stock so that their actions can be scrutinized. But she advocates for rules that would prohibit top executives from selling their company stock until three to five years after they\u2019ve left the company. \"We want them to be thinking long term up until the day they leave,\" she said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed that CEOs of 14 large companies received advance information about the coronavirus and then resigned in order to be freed from restrictions on selling stock.\n\nAmong the companies listed, only two of the CEOs resigned after the coronavirus outbreak and left their companies. One sold a large amount of his company stock after his resignation was announced \u2014 but while he was still with the company, and well after the outbreak had made news. We found no evidence of any effort to give advance information to the 14 CEOs so that they use it to profit personally.\n\nWe rate the claim False.", "date": "2020/03/29", "false_statement": " CEOs got advance notice of COVID, then resigned to dump stock.\t\t", "true_statement": " The post listed 14 companies. But only two had CEOs who stepped down from their posts, and left their companies, since the coronavirus first surfaced in China.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nDaily Sun, which describes itself as a leading English newspaper in Bangladesh, did post a story on March 26 with that headline, but it has since been deleted from the website. Google search results for the story show this snippet of the article, though: \"South African Prophet Rufus Phala allegedly gave his members Dettol, a household bleach to drink as a preventive medicine to coronavirus.\"\n\nThe same story appeared on March 19 on a website called Kenya Today. It goes on to say that 59 congregants were confirmed dead and four others are in critical condition after drinking Dettol.\n\nBut we couldn\u2019t find any news reports to corroborate that account.\n\nRather, the image appeared online in 2016 on the website of another Daily Sun \u2014 a newspaper in South Africa.

All four states have debt.\n\nStates commonly take on debt to pay for construction and environmental projects.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has put a massive strain on state budgets but some social media users have pointed the finger at Democrat-led states.\n\nA Facebook post lists metrics for the four most populous states including their budgets. It states that Texas and Florida have \"balanced\" budgets while California is \"in debt $54 billion and New York is \"in debt $6.1 billion.\" While this post didn\u2019t comment on the party affiliations of the governors, similar posts point out that the governors of Florida and Texas are Republicans while the governors of New York and California are Democrats.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post is misleading in multiple ways. It fails to explain some basics about state budgets.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s common for states to borrow money to construct state buildings, roads or environmental restoration. You can have debt and a balanced budget. And all of these states must pass a balanced budget.\n\nSecond, the post describes certain dollar amounts as \"debt\" when they were actually shortfalls. All four states, in fact, carry billions of dollars in debt.\n\nShortfalls occur when revenue collections come in lower than expected and/or expenditures can come in higher than forecasted, said Brian Sigritz, the Director of State Fiscal Studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. Comparing different states\u2019 budget gaps is difficult, because they tend to change month-to-month and states release revenue forecasts at different times.\n\nAmid COVID-19, Sigritz warned that \"some states may not have announced a budget gap figure yet, but will likely face a shortfall.\"\n\n\"Debt\" in the context of a state budget refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. A projected shortfall or budget gap is the amount that state officials have to address in order to balance a state budget.\n\nRELATED: New York pension fund does not need a federal bailout\n\nFlorida\u2019s budget, like all states, is expected to take a hit\n\nFlorida\u2019s total state direct debt outstanding as of June 30, 2019, was $20.6 billion.\n\n\"As for the impact of COVID-19, there is little official revenue data or estimates yet, although we know it will be big,\" said Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at Florida TaxWatch, a key budget watchdog organization.\n\nApril experienced an overall combined revenue loss of $878.1 million, the state estimated.\n\nWenner said that most officials believe there is enough in reserves and federal aid to avoid a deficit in this budget year.\n\n\"After the governor signs the new budget (and presumably vetoes a lot) and more revenue data comes in, we'll have a better idea of what the next fiscal year looks like,\" Wenner said.\n\nTexas\u2019 budget needs revisions, billions of dollars out of balance\n\nTexas passes a budget every two years and the current budget year ends on Aug. 31, 2021.\n\nThe state hasn\u2019t revised the budget but Comptroller Glenn Hegar has said the economy is in a recession and announced that state sales tax revenues from April 2019 compared to April 2020 saw the steepest decline since January 2010.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott requested state agencies and universities submit a plan by June 15 that uses savings to reduce their use of revenue by 5%.\n\nThe Texas Tribune reported that the budget will be \"billions of dollars out of balance.\"\n\nThe most recent calculations show Texas had a total of $59.9 billion in state debt by August 31, 2019.\n\nNew York\u2019s budget had a $6 billion budget gap, not debt\n\nNews articles at the end of 2019 stated that New York faced a $6.1 billion budget gap \u2014-- before the pandemic hit. (The Citizens Budget Commission said the amount was $7 billion.)\n\nIn April, the state Assembly passed a $177 billion budget by borrowing, relying on federal aid and deferring some decisions. The budget for the 2020-2021 year started in April.\n\nThe economic downturn has worsened the state\u2019s finances. Before the pandemic, the state was expecting a 7% increase in revenue, but now it is expecting a 14% decline in revenue. A state estimate on April 25 puts revenue losses at $13.3 billion this year and $61 billion over the next four years.\n\nOutstanding debt at the end of fiscal year 2020, which closed on March 31, was $54.4 billion.

In the 2020-21 budget Newsom proposed in January, the state of California planned to pay part of this debt and had a projected $5.6 billion budget surplus for the 2020-21 fiscal year.\n\nThis was before COVID-19 shut down businesses and led to high unemployment in California.

Third, it\u2019s difficult to compare the current financial status of four different states because they have different budget cycles and the impact of the pandemic remains a moving economic target.\n\nWhile Florida and Texas have passed balance budgets, they too are certain to face economic woes related to the pandemic.\n\nIn early May, California officials projected a $54 billion shortfall, but a new budget proposal lays out a plan to balance the budget, although it still leaves a projected future deficit.\n\nThe $6.1 billion figure for New York stems from projections late last year about a shortfall, and ignores that the state has since passed a balanced budget.\n\nThis statement rates False.", "date": "2020/05/18", "false_statement": " Texas and Florida have a \u201cbalanced budget\u201d while California is \u201cin debt $54 billion and New York is \u201cin debt $6.1 billion.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Facebook post gets debt wrong in comparison of Florida, Texas, California and New York.

Even at age 79, he is one of the top advisers to President Donald Trump on the coronavirus crisis.\n\nYet Ron Paul, a sometimes conspiracy-minded Texas doctor, former GOP congressman and former presidential candidate, seemed to raise a fair question about a coronavirus statement made by Fauci.\n\nCalling Fauci \"the chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration,\" Paul wrote in a column on his website that Fauci \"testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.\"\n\nWe wondered about the scientific basis attack.

(Several factors apply, such as age and health.)\n\nA study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China diagnosed as of Feb. 11, 2020, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a fatality rate of 2.3%. A March 3, 2020, estimate from the World Health Organization put the figure at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals. Some people who die never report having had coronavirus.\n\nThe latest daily report on COVID-19 from the World Health Organization, issued March 16, 2020, said there have been 167,515 confirmed cases and 6,606 deaths. That\u2019s a death rate of 3.9%.\n\nThe flu death rate is much lower.\n\nIn its latest weekly report on the 2019-20 flu, for the week ending March 7, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been 36 million flu illnesses and 22,000 deaths.

The CDC recommends all children receive the vaccine at ages 11-12, though it can be used as early as age 9 and up to age 26.\n\nThe vaccine can prevent cancer-causing HPV infections.\n\nShipley said in the interview he wanted to raise a point that young people have less risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 than older adults. He said young people should return to work, though public health experts say it isn\u2019t safe for them to do so yet.\n\n\"What I\u2019ve seen is a lot of young people are voicing that they\u2019d much rather stay on welfare or unemployment than go back to work, and now they\u2019re kind of complaining that they have to go to work, and they\u2019re saying they don\u2019t feel safe,\" Shipley said. \"I was really upset and kind of angry. And they say they are unsafe, but there\u2019s really no data to support that.\"\n\nWhile older adults are most at risk of dying from COVID-19, young people are not immune. In Iowa, 2 percent of deaths from COVID-19 have been individuals under the age of 40.\n\nIn the U.S, at least 325 people under the age of 35 have died of COVID-19 as of May 6, according to the CDC, though this accounts for less than 1 percent of COVID-19 deaths nationwide.\n\nData from the World Health Organizations indicates that in studies of the HPV vaccine, the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in those who received the vaccine than those who received a placebo injection.\n\nChristine Petersen, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Disease at the University of Iowa, said in a phone interview the risk of dying of COVID-19 is higher, given that no deaths have ever been linked to the HPV vaccine.\n\nThe HPV vaccine prevents the most common types of human papillomavirus strains, which can cause cervical and other cancers.\n\n\"Roughly, for every 100,000 people in the state of Iowa, there are five who have had cervical cancer, there\u2019s been zero that have died from the vaccine. We know that across the Iowa population, 7.27 people out of 100,000 have died of coronavirus,\" Peterson said.\n\nShipley said he believes people who are most at risk should be social distancing, while younger adults can return to work.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of ways we can protect ourselves and enforce social distancing between myself and my parents and my grandparents or whoever it is,\" Shipley said. \"Just because there are people at risk, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we all need to stay home, collect government checks, and not go to work.\"\n\nPetersen warned that separating those at-risk from those who are not is not an easy task.\n\n\"I would caution that it\u2019s not so easy to target at risk or not at-risk people,\" Petersen said. \"You can be undiagnosed with a disease that can cause you to be impressively immune compromised and not even know it yourself yet, or you can not want to declare it to the rest of the world.\"\n\nPetersen said COVID-19 still has a reproductive rate of 2 in Iowa, meaning on average, each positive case will spread the virus to two others.\n\n\"Those people may not show symptoms for at least a day, maybe two, so taking precautions isn\u2019t just to protect yourself, it\u2019s to protect those at risk people,\" Petersen said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nShipley wrote that young people are more at risk from the HPV vaccine than COVID-19. Both the CDC and the WHO have concluded that no deaths have been caused by the HPV vaccine, while young people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S and in Iowa.\n\nWhile young people are less at risk from the coronavirus than older people, adhering to social distancing protects people at risk of having greater complications from the coronavirus \u2013 including those who might not yet know they are at a higher risk. Moreover, Shipley conceded that he made the statement in order to start a discussion, not to give accurate information that could be taken literally.

Younger people, even though they may not be as susceptible to the coronavirus, can still serve as carriers for the virus, potentially infecting new communities through travel.\n\nRELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump\u2019s mistakes about European travel due to coronavirus\n\nThe World Health Organization has similar guidance for international travelers, although it advises against travel bans like the one implemented by the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is prudent for travellers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas, in particular for elderly travellers and people with chronic diseases or underlying health conditions,\" read its recommendations. \"General recommendations for personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one metre from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for all travellers.\"\n\nUS and other countries issue travel warnings\n\nThe U.S. State Department is advising all citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the spread of COVID-19. Other countries have issued similar travel warnings.\n\nSince January, the State Department has issued several travel advisories related to the COVID-19 outbreak. As of March 13, China and Iran had \"Level 4: Do Not Travel\" advisories \u2014 the highest issued by the State Department \u2014 while countries like Azerbaijan, Italy and South Korea were labeled as \"Level 3: Reconsider Travel.\"\n\nOn March 11, the State Department also issued a global health advisory asking Americans to reconsider traveling abroad.\n\nSource: WHO\n\n\"Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions,\" reads the Level 3 advisory. \"Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.\"\n\nOther countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have issued similar travel advisories.\n\n\"It may not be safe to fly, especially if you\u2019re going to one of the COVID-19 hotspots,\" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in an email. \"Generally speaking, it is just unwise to be traveling in any form right now.\"\n\nHow safe are airplanes?\n\nIf you do have to travel via airplane, you\u2019re unlikely to get sick while on board, officials say \u2014 as long as you practice good hygiene.\n\nThe WHO says there is little risk of disease transmission during a flight, mostly due to the way cabin air is filtered. During the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another human coronavirus, in 2003, the risk of disease transmission on airplanes was found to be very low.\n\nPlus, airlines are taking extra steps to clean airplanes and slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"Airlines are being more cautious about passengers, they\u2019re doing extra cleaning and disinfecting and they are restricting flights,\" Watanabe said. \"So one might consider flying to be safer than ever.\"\n\nStill, it is possible to catch something from an infected person seated in the same area as you.\n\nRELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself\n\nAccording to the CDC, COVID-19 spreads in two primary ways: close person-to-person contact (within about six feet) and respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes. If someone with the virus sneezes, those germs could land on surfaces around them, such as airplane seats and armrests. Then, an uninfected person who touches that same surface and then touches their nose, eyes or mouth could contract the virus.\n\nIf you do need to travel by plane, public health officials advise practicing good personal hygiene. The ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus include washing your hands with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, and avoiding people who are sick.\n\n\"We are trying to understand the \u2018rules\u2019 that govern transmission of COVID-19 and relative risk from people at different stages of disease, and/or contaminated surfaces and more,\" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. \"It seems unwise for commentators to offer travel advice until we who are more expert know far more.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nEarhardt said that \"it's actually the safest time to fly.\"\n\nOfficials from the CDC and WHO are advising older people and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider travel in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The State Department has issued travel advisories for several individual countries, as well as a global health advisory, related to the disease outbreak. Other countries have taken similar steps. While the disease transmission on airplanes is thought to be a low risk, it is still possible to contract the coronavirus through close personal contact and respiratory droplets.\n\nEarhardt\u2019s statement is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "date": "2020/03/13", "false_statement": " \u201cIt\u2019s actually the safest time to fly.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Older Americans and those with chronic conditions are advised to reconsider all travel plans to avoid COVID-19.

It ensured that face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus.

As a result, doctors are forced to ration supplies and, in some cases, cease using necessary protective equipment.\"\n\nThere are clear problems in the U.S. medical supply chain. A mad dash for masks and other supplies has created logistical hurdles and frenzied dealmaking in the global market, including in China.\n\nAnd Rubio\u2019s concerns about the U.S. relying on China for supplies are not new. He raised them more than a year ago.\n\n\"Although American pharmaceutical firms face short-term commercial opportunities in China, the U.S. runs the risk of losing important components of its medical supply chain to China\u2019s government-backed industry,\" Rubio wrote in a report in February 2019.\n\nBut in his op-ed, Rubio overstates the problem with Chinese imports and ignores some key factors \u2014 including that imports were declining before COVID-19 as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\"Sen. Rubio\u2019s comment is typical of \u2018bash China\u2019 remarks, but inaccurate,\" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"China is exporting millions of masks.\"\n\nWe reached out to spokespersons for Rubio and did not receive a response.\n\nImports from China dropped in January and February\n\nThere were fears that China would not export critical medical supplies to the U.S. as COVID-19 cases ramped up. China produces much of the world\u2019s protective medical equipment.\n\nThere was a dip, but the exports did continue.\n\nChina\u2019s exports of protective medical equipment to the U.S. declined by 19% in January and February, compared with the same period last year. All other products fell by a far greater amount: 28%, according to an analysis by Chad Bown at the Peterson Institute.\n\n\"We imported less from them for these products than we did last year, but some of that is economics: They have more demand for these things internally, so they had less of an ability to export them to the world,\" Bown told PolitiFact.\n\nNew export restrictions by China also created logjams. Officials in China said the restrictions were imposed to ensure quality, but U.S. companies said they were facing bottlenecks, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn February, the United States was focused on exporting supplies to China to fight the crisis.\n\nTrump administration tariffs impacted imports\n\nThe drop in imports of masks from China is not related only to COVID-19. Rubio\u2019s op-ed did not mention the Trump administration\u2019s increase on tariffs for various goods from China in 2018-19. That also affects imports of medical supplies.\n\nIn 2018, Matt Rowan, president of the Health Industry Distributors Association, warned that proposed tariffs would drive up health care costs. The products \"are used widely throughout health care settings and are a critical component of our nation's response to public health emergencies, such as Ebola,\" he said at a federal government hearing.\n\nThe tariff hikes for personal protective equipment and other supplies went through in September 2019 despite such warnings. U.S. imports of masks, respirators and gloves from China fell following the tariff increases. In March 2020, the federal government established a temporary exclusion for masks.\n\n\"In other words, the fall in imports from China is largely a self-imposed wound,\" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and trade expert who is also a Peterson fellow.\n\nThe decrease in imports followed the shutdown of manufacturing regions in China in the country, she said.\n\nThe U.S. government has tried to increase the flow of supplies from China, including authorizing the use of a Chinese version of N95 masks.\n\nFeds, states have imported supplies from China\n\nOne more point: The U.S. has imported masks and other supplies from China in recent weeks.\n\nOn March 29, Trump announced an operation called Project Air Bridge to bring medical supplies from overseas. The project\u2019s first flight came from China on March 29 and brought millions of supplies, including 130,000 N95 masks.\n\nProject Air Bridge has delivered more than 760,000 N95 masks, 600 million gloves, 52 million surgical masks in addition to other supplies including surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said. Those supplies came from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, Honduras and Mexico.\n\nFrom China alone, there have been over 133 million units of imported N95 masks, gloves, surgical masks, surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, FEMA said.\n\nSome states have arranged their own imported masks or other supplies from China.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said \"face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus\" while the U.S. was \"largely unable to import supplies from China.\"\n\nChina did have a greater need for its domestically manufactured masks in February as the virus ravaged the country, but Rubio greatly overstates the situation. Imports of masks from China to the U.S. did drop in January and February, but imports of other products dropped even more. Imports to the U.S. did occur in April through the federal government\u2019s Project Air Bridge, and a few states arranged their own imports with the help of other entities.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "date": "2020/04/20", "false_statement": " \u201cFace masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus\u201d while the U.S. was \u201clargely unable to import supplies from China.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " All imports from China fell during January and February 2020, compared with a year earlier, but did not disappear entirely.

PolitiFact tried to reach him without success.\n\nThe post links to a Dec. 1 letter from the men to the European Medicines Agency seeking to stop clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine in the European Union.\n\n\"Several vaccine candidates are expected to induce the formation of humoral antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2,\" the letter says. \"Syncytin-1\u2026 which is derived from human endogenous retroviruses \u2026 and is responsible for the development of a placenta in mammals and humans and is therefore an essential prerequisite for a successful pregnancy, is also found in homologous form in the spike proteins of SARS viruses. There is no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS viruses would also act like anti-Syncytin-1 antibodies. However, if this were to be the case, this would then prevent the formation of a placenta which would result in vaccinated women essentially becoming infertile.\"\n\nBrent Stockwell, a professor studying disease networks and chemical and biological tools at Columbia University, told us that the claim that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility isn\u2019t true.\n\nHumans do have a protein called syncytin-1, which is critical in developing the placenta during pregnancy, Stockwell said in an email. \"Theoretically, an immune response against this protein could cause increased risk of a failed pregnancy.\"\n\nBut if the claims in the blog post were accurate, that would mean that pregnant women who catch COVID-19 would also become infertile, he said. No increased infertility or pregnancy loss has been observed in women with COVID-19.\n\n\"Any hint of similarity between syncytin-1 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (which is used as part of the vaccine) is extremely remote,\" he said. \"There are hardly any parts of the two proteins that are even vaguely similar, and they are far more distinct than would be needed for cross-reactivity of immune responses.\"\n\nIn short, he said there\u2019s no chance that the COVID-19 vaccine would train the immune system to accidentally recognize and fight syncytin-1.\n\nPfizer told us in a statement that there\u2019s no data to suggest that the company\u2019s vaccine candidate causes infertility.\n\nExperts interviewed by The Associated Press, which also looked into this post, corroborated this.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe blog post says: \"Head of Pfizer research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization.\"\n\nThe head of Pfizer research didn\u2019t say this.

Rick Santorum on Monday defended President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak in an interview with CNN anchor John King.\n\n\"The president looks like he was ahead of the curve \u2013 as you know, he talks about this all the time \u2013 on shutting down travel from China,\" said Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania who lost his bid for a third term in 2006.\n\nSantorum\u2019s comments came one day after Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, told CNN anchor Jake Tapper that earlier implementation of social-distancing and stay-at-home orders could have saved lives lost to the coronavirus.\n\nSantorum called Fauci\u2019s remarks \"Monday morning quarterbacking\" and sought to redirect attention to other coronavirus mitigation strategies he believes the Trump administration embraced early on. Fauci, later on Monday, said his remarks were hypothetical.\n\nWe wondered whether Trump\u2019s decision to restrict travel from China was as prescient as Santorum described.\n\nThe administration announced the restrictions on Jan. 31 and they took effect two days later. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the country.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he acted to restrict travel \u2013 first from China, then from Iran and finally from Europe \u2013 despite objections from experts.\n\n\"But we closed those borders very early, against the advice of a lot of professionals, and we turned out to be right. I took a lot of heat for that,\" Trump said on March 4.\n\nLater that same day, Trump spoke about the rationale behind his decision, telling Fox anchor Sean Hannity, \"Everybody said, it\u2019s too early, it\u2019s too soon, and good people, brilliant people, in many ways, doctors and lawyers and, frankly, a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively. And they said, don\u2019t do it.\"\n\nTrump repeated the claim again at the Scranton town hall he held on March 5, saying he imposed the travel restrictions \"against the advice of almost everybody.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization did caution against the overuse of travel restrictions around the time the one imposed by the U.S. first took effect, but public health officials in this country and many airlines themselves agreed on the policy\u2019s importance.\n\nSeveral airlines voluntarily halted flights between the U.S. and China a few days before the administration\u2019s travel restrictions took effect. And Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said experts in his department all agreed that restricting travel from countries with coronavirus outbreaks was the right call.\n\n\"The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,\" Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. \"These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\"\n\nWhat was the rest of the world thinking at the same time? We consulted Think Global Health, an initiative of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations that is tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19.\n\nBy the group\u2019s count, about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States. That number covers variations of travel restrictions in effect up to and including Feb. 1.\n\nThink Global Health\u2019s tracker includes partial or total land border closures, suspension of flights to and from China, visa restrictions, such as a pause on visa-on-arrival programs, and entry restrictions (similar to what the United States implemented).\n\n\"While the United States was not one of the first countries to impose restrictions against travel from China, nor was it late to do so relative to the actions of others,\" said Samantha Kiernan, a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Rather, the United States acted around the same time that many other countries did.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSantorum said, \"The president looks like he was ahead of the curve \u2013 as you know, he talks about this all the time \u2013 on shutting down travel from China.\"\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t \"ahead of the curve,\" as Santorum said.

But he didn\u2019t specifically say he \"wanted\" states to declare bankruptcy, only that he supports it as an option.\n\n\"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available,\" McConnell said. \"My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.\"\n\nAs The Atlantic reported, McConnell expanded on his bankruptcy comments in another radio interview that day:\n\n\"We\u2019re not interested in solving their pension problems for them. We\u2019re not interested in rescuing them from bad decisions they've made in the past, we\u2019re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created themselves (with) bad decisions in the past.\"\n\nWhat Tillis said\n\nThat brings us to Tillis and how closely he has \"agreed\" with McConnell.\n\nAudio of the April 24 town hall shows a constituent named Charles saying he has a question about the future: \"Will the Senate vote to bail out poorly-run states that were near bankrupt before COVID-19 hit?\"\n\nTillis wasn\u2019t asked about states in general. He was asked specifically about \"poorly-run states that were near bankrupt\" prior to the pandemic. Tillis said he doesn\u2019t think those states should be bailed out.\n\n\"Well, Charles, that's a great question and personally I don't think we should, and I don't think that we can,\" Tillis said.\n\nHe then said the $2 trillion economic stimulus gave him \"pause,\" but was worth it. Then he used North Carolina\u2019s state government as an example of good financial stewardship:\n\n\"I'm not so sure that taxpayer dollars for North Carolina should go to a state, a county, or a city that, like you said, was in poor economic shape before we ever had the virus. We need to take care of first responders. We need to take care of law enforcement. And we will do that. But I don't believe that I can support any measure that is effectively a bailout for poorly run state and local governments.\n\n\"We can look at things on a case-by-case basis where it's very clear that the damage is done because of the virus impact. But a broad-based bailout is not something I'd be prepared to support.\"\n\nThat\u2019s when Tillis brought up McConnell\u2019s comments.\n\n\"You probably heard Leader McConnell's comments about it, I'm more or less aligned with Leader McConnell on the issue,\" Tillis said, a few seconds later adding: \"I think we need to work on executing (plans already signed into law) and not really entertain a discussion of trillions more going into jurisdictions that really need to get their financial houses in order.\"\n\nCunningham spokeswoman Rachel Petri said Tillis\u2019s comments about McConnell show he\u2019s in lockstep with the Senate leader, who said \"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.\"\n\nTillis elaborated on his position in an interview with Fox News radio's Guy Benson on April 29. Benson asked him about McConnell\u2019s comments that money should not cover pre-pandemic budget holes (without mentioning the bankruptcy idea).\n\nTillis said the Senate \"will go back and take a look at well-documented cases for the costs of the response, potentially the cause of some of the revenues in this year based on closures.\"\n\nWhen PolitiFact asked about Tillis\u2019 position on the bankruptcy option, Tillis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said:\n\n\"Sen. Tillis has never advocated for any state or municipality to go bankrupt as a result of COVID-19, has already delivered billions of dollars in relief to North Carolina, and has consistently said that he supports providing targeted assistance for communities that have been impacted by the virus.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCunningham tweeted, \"Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed.\" The tweet lacks so much context that it\u2019s several degrees removed from what\u2019s actually been said.\n\nMcConnell wasn\u2019t talking about just any states, he was talking about states that were in poor financial shape before the coronavirus outbreak. Additionally, McConnell said he supported bankruptcy as a novel option for states, particularly for those with pre-existing pension liabilities.\n\nTillis said he agreed with McConnell \"more or less.\" He agreed that Congress shouldn\u2019t pay for revenue losses that aren\u2019t related to the coronavirus outbreak. But Tillis never actually said he wanted states to go bankrupt. And he said he will consider federal aid for smaller governments on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCunningham\u2019s tweet exaggerates what McConnell said and misrepresents what Tilils has said about federal coronavirus aid. It contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Dan Bishop has been one of North Carolina\u2019s most vocal opponents of Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s stay-at-home order.\n\nBishop, a Republican elected in 2019 to represent southwest NC, has attended protests urging Cooper to \"reopen\" the state\u2019s economy. But in an interview on April 24, the congressman made a comment about the U.S. economy that caught our attention.\n\nOn Spicer & Co., the show of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer on the conservative Newsmax TV, he said \"half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.\"\n\nHere are his full comments:\n\n\"People who are elderly or who have underlying conditions that would subject them to the worst ravages of the coronavirus should take additional measures and, in fact, I don't object to government taking measures to see to it that those people are particularly protected,\" he said.\n\n\"But it\u2019s quite another step to utterly devastate the economic landscape in a way \u2014 and I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve seen a figure that better summarizes how bad it is, as the suggestion you just put up \u2014 that half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.\"\n\nIs it true that half of the American workforce has been idled? And what \"figure\" is Bishop referring to?\n\nAccording to Bishop\u2019s spokeswoman, Hannah Hummelberg, the congressman was referring to a New York Times stat that Spicer mentioned earlier in the segment.\n\n\"The number of unemployment claims filed so far is equal to the total workforce, get this, of 25 states,\" Spicer said. (Spicer\u2019s comment comes around the 1:15 mark of this video, while Bishop makes his claim shortly after the 4:30 mark.)\n\nClearly, a chunk of the American population has filed for unemployment. But does it add up to half of the U.S. workforce? No.\n\nUnemployment\n\nBy citing the New York Times stat, Bishop tied his definition of \"idle\" to unemployment numbers. So let\u2019s put the Times\u2019 stat in perspective.\n\nThere were about 160 million workers in the U.S. around the start of the year. That\u2019s according to experts we interviewed, previous PolitiFact reporting, and numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nObviously, 26 million workers \u2014 the New York Times unemployment stat cited by Bishop \u2014 is not half of 160 million. So it\u2019s wrong to suggest half of the U.S. is unemployed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not \"statistically sound\" to equate 26 million workers with \"half\" of the country, said Ryan Bourne, the R. Evan Scharf Chair for the Public Understanding of Economics at the Cato Institute. Cato is a think tank that advocates for free markets.\n\nAnd the New York Times comparison wouldn\u2019t work with just any grouping of 25 states. In California alone, there are 19 million workers.\n\n\"Since our population is not spread evenly across the states, the working population of 25 states doesn't provide an estimate of 50% of the national workforce,\" said Tara Sinclair, associate professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nUncounted workers\n\nThe Times\u2019 stat alone isn\u2019t enough to support Bishop\u2019s claim. So let\u2019s explore other estimates of U.S. unemployment.\n\nThere are people that unemployment reports don\u2019t account for, such as those who are furloughed or who are working reduced hours.\n\nDean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the number of people who filed for unemployment isn\u2019t complete. He said there are several million more people who either could not get their forms in or were ineligible.\n\n(In North Carolina, for example, the phone lines at the state\u2019s unemployment office were so busy that many people claimed they couldn\u2019t get through to file claims.)\n\nBaker thinks the number of unemployed Americans is somewhere between 20-25%, he said in an May 5 email. \"I would be hesitant to use one much higher,\" he said.\n\nCNN estimated that 43 million workers were either out of work or working reduced hours in April alone.\n\nPublic surveys\n\nBourne, the CATO expert, said Bishop\u2019s claim would only be valid if considered very broadly.\n\nHe referenced a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation that said 55% of workers had either lost jobs, lost pay, lost hours, or been furloughed since Feb. 1.\n\nThe definition of \"idled\" is to not work or not do something. It\u2019s a reference to inaction. The Kaiser survey included people who lost pay, but might still be working.\n\n\"This, as you can see, highlights the scale of the economic impacts of the virus and response, but is a different claim entirely,\" Bourne said.\n\nOn April 21, three days before Bishop\u2019s claim, the Pew Research Center published a study on how the coronavirus response affected the wages of American workers.\n\nAbout 28% said they or someone in their household has been laid off or lost their job. When asked if someone in the house had lost their job or taken a pay cut, 43% said yes.\n\nGross Domestic Product\n\nChris Lafakis, a director at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the workforce can also be judged by the U.S. GDP. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. over the course of a year.\n\nIt fell 4.8% in the first three months of the year (the first quarter), according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The bureau\u2019s second quarter numbers run through June and are not yet available.\n\nDeutsche Bank expects GDP to drop \"nearly 40%\" in the second quarter, according to Business Insider. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office almost mirrors that estimate, expecting a 39% drop.\n\n\"Most economists\" don\u2019t expect GDP to dip by 50%, Lafakis said. Moody\u2019s expects GDP to decline 33% at an annualized rate in quarter two.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBishop said \"half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.\"\n\nBishop took a stat that\u2019s meant to illustrate the magnitude of unemployment and misused it to falsely say half of the country\u2019s workers are unemployed.\n\nThe U.S. workforce is roughly 160 million people. We found no official counts or expert estimates showing unemployment has reached half of that figure.\n\nBishop\u2019s claim is only valid if we consider that 26 million people is equal to the working population of a specific group of 25 states, or if we look past the definition of \"idle\" and consider Americans who weren\u2019t laid off, but whose wages were affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHis claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The total U.S. workforce is about 160 million people, so 26 million is not half of that. The economy can also be measured by trends in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. But experts said they don't expect GDP to fall 50%."}

There\u2019s also no evidence that consuming cold things makes you more susceptible to the virus.\n\nThere is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes or exposing your clothing to the sun can help prevent the coronavirus.\n\nAn audio message lists 10 ways people can avoid contracting COVID-19. We fact-checked five of the most questionable claims.\n\nA false post about COVID-19 is being shared in a new format on Facebook.\n\nIn an audio message that a reader sent us on March 23, a woman with a British accent lists 10 ways that people can avoid being infected with the coronavirus. The message claims to be based on research from Chinese scientists.\n\n\"It was sent to me by a colleague who has a friend that works at Dr. Negrin, which is the main hospital on our island,\" says the woman on the audio message. \"It\u2019s obviously in Spanish, so I\u2019m just going to read it and translate it for you.\"\n\nUniversity Hospital of Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin is located in the city of Las Palmas on Gran Canaria, one of Spain\u2019s Canary Islands. The island chain\u2019s tourism industry has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the questionable medical advice in the audio message that caught our eye:\n\n\"Take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes\"\n\nHang clothes \"in direct sunlight, which also neutralizes the virus\"\n\n\"Wash your hands every 20 minutes\"\n\n\"Try to avoid eating and drinking cold things\"\n\n\"Wash metallic surfaces very carefully because the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days\"\n\nIf some of those claims sound familiar, it\u2019s because many of them have been circulating on social media in some form since January, when the World Health Organization addressed a slew of COVID-19 rumors on Twitter. We\u2019ve also debunked several bogus coronavirus prevention and treatment methods.\n\nBut this audio message was new to us, so we decided to check out each of the five claims. All of them either lack evidence or have been debunked by public health officials.\n\n\"Take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes\"\n\nThis is inaccurate \u2014 we rated a similar claim False.\n\nWhile health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection.\n\nThe primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nSo to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus.\n\nIn a tweet published Feb. 7, the WHO said it does not advise people to drink water as a way to avoid coronavirus infection.\n\nHang clothes \"in direct sunlight, which also neutralizes the virus\"\n\nWhile air-drying your clothes may save you some money on your electricity bill, there is no evidence it will kill the coronavirus. We\u2019ve rated similar claims False.\n\nThere is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don\u2019t like heat. Influenza, for example, thrives in dry, cold weather, which is one reason the flu season typically spans from fall to spring. And high-intensity UV light can kill viruses.\n\nRELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean sun exposure kills the coronavirus. Experts told us natural sunlight doesn\u2019t provide the UV intensity needed to kill the virus, and the WHO says on its website that COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, \"including areas with hot and humid weather.\"\n\nNeither the WHO nor the CDC lists sunlight exposure as a method to kill the coronavirus. In fact, the WHO has debunked the claim, saying \"there is no evidence that sunlight kills the new coronavirus.\"\n\n\"Wash your hands every 20 minutes\"\n\nPublic health officials say washing your hands is one of the primary ways to prevent COVID-19 infection. But if you\u2019re healthy and in self-isolation, there is probably little reason to lather up so frequently.\n\nThe CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time \u2014 \"especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\"\n\nOn its website, UNICEF lists a few more examples of when people should wash their hands: \"after touching surfaces outside the home, including money; before, during and after caring for a sick person; and before and after eating.\"\n\nSo if you\u2019re doing any of those things every 20 minutes, you may want to wash your hands.\n\n\"Try to avoid eating and drinking cold things\"\n\nThis claim is baseless.\n\nAs we\u2019ve covered before, there is evidence that human coronaviruses don\u2019t like heat. But just as there\u2019s no scientific proof that hot things prevent COVID-19, there\u2019s no proof that cold things make you more susceptible.\n\nThis claim is similar to one made in a fake UNICEF handout that circulated on Facebook in early March. It said people should \"stay away from ice cream and eating cold\" to avoid contracting COVID-19.\n\nIn a statement, UNICEF debunked that claim. On its website, the WHO did, too.\n\n\"There is no scientific evidence that eating hygienically made frozen food and ice-cream spreads the new coronavirus,\" the organization says.\n\n\"Wash metallic surfaces very carefully because the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days\"\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support this.\n\nAn article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17 tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard.\n\n\"SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),\" the authors wrote. \"SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.\"\n\nRELATED: Novel coronavirus could live up to 3 days, depending on the surface\n\nAside from air, the least hospitable medium for the virus was copper; researchers could detect viable virus particles there for only up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel \u2014 up to three days.\n\nThat\u2019s far from nine days, as the audio message claimed. And while the journal article hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed, its findings are similar to those of other researchers.\n\nAn article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about the surface viability of various coronaviruses that infect humans, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19. The authors wrote that scientists found some of these viruses could live for up to five days on steel, and eight hours on aluminum. Another study they cited found a SARS virus strain remaining viable for up to five days on an unspecified metal.\n\nThe article did find that one strain of SARS could live for up to nine days on plastic surfaces. But two other strains of the virus remained viable for only five days or less, and MERS could live for only up to 48 hours at a certain temperature.\n\nMore recently, a March 23 report from the CDC said novel coronavirus RNA was found on surfaces on the Diamond Princess cruise ship 17 days after passengers disembarked. That finding raised questions about whether the coronavirus can last longer on some surfaces than previously thought, but researchers have noted that viral RNA doesn\u2019t necessarily mean live virus was present.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA chain audio message on Facebook Messenger lists 10 ways to prevent infection from COVID-19. We fact-checked five and found them inaccurate.\n\nFirst, there is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. There is also no evidence that exposing your clothing to the sun will kill the coronavirus.\n\nHealth officials recommend that people avoid touching their face and wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at a time \u2014 not every 20 minutes, as the message claims. There\u2019s also no evidence that consuming cold things makes you more susceptible to the virus.\n\nFinally, while the science is far from settled, there\u2019s no proof that the coronavirus can live for up to nine days on metallic surfaces. The best available evidence suggests that it can remain viable on stainless steel for up to three days.\n\nWe rate the claims False.\n\nIf you receive a chain message that you want us to fact-check, send a screenshot to [email protected] or forward it to us on Facebook.", "date": "2020/03/23", "false_statement": " An audio message lists five ways people can prevent the novel coronavirus.\t\t", "true_statement": " There is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes or exposing your clothing to the sun can help prevent the coronavirus.

Even if someone receives a bigger stimulus payment in 2020 than their next tax return says they should have received, they will not owe back the difference, much less the entire amount.\n\nAre those $1,200 payments that are meant to cushion the financial blow of the coronavirus just a loan that Americans will have to pay back next year? That\u2019s what a variety of social media posts are saying.\n\nA reader sent us a link to a YouTube video titled, \"Truth About Those Stimulus Checks.\" In turn, this YouTube video showed a TikTok created by user @hunnerj9797. (This TikTok has also been shared via Facebook.)\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of the TikTok:\n\n\"This is something I found out today about those $1,200 stimulus checks that you may be receiving with the new coronavirus stimulus package bill. Where am I getting my information? Literally, directly from the bill itself. If you go to 'Subtitle B: Rebates and Other Individual Provisions,' it outlines exactly what you're going to get: the $1,200, $2,400 for the joint, for equal and qualified persons.\n\n\"See, what they don't tell you is this is just an advance on your next tax return. 'There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by Subtitle A for the first taxable year beginning in 2020.' It even further outlines it is literally 'an advance refund amount.' So that means next year, you're automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season. Guys, stay safe out there. Media and public is not telling you exactly what this bill is.\"\n\nAt issue are checks being cut by the federal government for essentially every American who doesn\u2019t exceed the income cutoff.\n\nThe amount of these checks (or direct deposits) will be $1,200 per adult and $500 per child under age 17, as long as you don\u2019t have income exceeding $75,000 per individual or $150,000 per couple. This means a family of four would get $3,400. (Above those income cutoffs, you\u2019ll still get a check, but it will phase out by $5 for every $100 in additional income.)\n\nIn our analysis of the bill shortly before it passed, we wrote that Americans won\u2019t have to pay taxes on the stimulus checks. Analysts told us that the government is effectively implementing a tax cut for 2020 and giving people an advance on what they would have saved.\n\nIs that still the plan? When we checked in with tax experts, they told us the TikTok offers a misreading of the coronavirus relief bill. (Admittedly, the legislative language is tough to parse.)\n\nJanet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said the rebate in the law is a refundable tax credit, meaning that people are entitled to the full amount they qualify for, even if they do not owe any income taxes.\n\nThe law also says the credit is based on the taxpayer\u2019s circumstances in 2020. But for now, neither the IRS nor the taxpayer knows how much income they will receive in 2020.\n\n\"So the act specifies that the rebate paid now, in advance, will be based on the information from the most recent tax return filed with the IRS,\" Holtzblatt told PolitiFact. That would be either the 2019 return, if it\u2019s filed already, or else the 2018 return.\n\nNow, flash-forward to early 2021, when a 2020 tax return will be filed. At that time, the amount of the rebate will be recomputed based on the actual 2020 income. \"If the taxpayer should have gotten more than the advance credit paid this year, then he or she will get the additional amount next year,\" Holtzblatt said.\n\nHowever, if it turns out that the taxpayer got a larger advance rebate based on their 2019 or 2018 return, the law says that they do not have to pay back the excess, she said.\n\nTo make this more concrete, Holtzblatt offered a few scenarios for a taxpayer who ended up receiving $1,000 this year rather than the maximum of $1,200:\n\n\u2022 If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $1,200, the taxpayer will get the additional $200 next year.\n\n\u2022 If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $1,000, they get nothing additional and they owe nothing back.\n\n\u2022 If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $800, the taxpayer does not owe back the excess $200 they received the year before.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe posts say that the $1,200 coronavirus relief checks being issued this year are \"just an advance on your next tax return. \u2026 Next year, you're automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not what the law says.

It has recently taken steps to ramp up its testing capabilities.\n\nFox Business host Lou Dobbs, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and his allies, challenged the president\u2019s top health official recently on the administration\u2019s handling of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDobbs criticized Health and Human Secretary Alex Azar over a lack of transparency in the agency\u2019s handling of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 91,000 people globally across 73 countries and led to more than nine American deaths.\n\n\"There\u2019s a better ratio of testing for the coronavirus in other countries than we maintain here,\" Dobbs said during the March 2 interview on his TV show. \"We\u2019re actually screening fewer people because we don\u2019t have appropriate testing.\"\n\nAzar countered that the Trump administration has taken recent steps to roll back regulations and increase the availability of diagnostic test kits to \"hundreds and thousands and millions.\"\n\nThe United States is set to significantly expand its testing capabilities in the coming days and weeks, but Dobbs is correct that the country has lagged behind other nations so far.\n\n\"It is true that diagnostic capacity in the U.S. has been lower than in some other countries, but that is changing,\" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nThe trouble with testing numbers\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint how many people have been tested for the coronavirus, both in the U.S. and around the world. The World Health Organization doesn\u2019t track the number of tests administered in each country, and the numbers that are available are constantly updating.\n\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, a Fox News spokesperson representing Dobbs cited data from the WorldOMeter, a real-time tool that \"shows estimated current numbers based on statistics and projections from the most reputable official organizations,\" according to its website.\n\nUsing estimates derived from official government sources, the WorldOMeter says at least eight countries \u2014 South Korea, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Vietnam and Turkey \u2014 have given more tests relative to the size of their populations than the United States.\n\nThat lines up with experts\u2019 analyses and with what multiple news outlets have reported.\n\nMarc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said South Korea \"has screened at least thousands, and Guangdong, China, has screened at least hundreds of thousands,\" citing a WHO report on the outbreak in China, where the virus was first detected.\n\nSouth Korea ramped up testing by building drive-thru screening clinics for speedy assessments, according to local reports. Other countries, like Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Italy have also conducted thousands of diagnostic tests.\n\n\"We have done nothing like what other countries have done,\" Lipsitch said, noting that the U.S. had, until recently, limited not only the number of labs that were allowed to conduct tests on suspected cases, but also the number of patients that were eligible to be screened.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say just how far behind the U.S. has fallen, due to the murkiness around the number of administered tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped releasing a public count of tests on March 2.\n\nThe administration\u2019s public statements haven\u2019t cleared it up. On Feb. 29, the CDC reported testing 472 Americans. A day later, Azar told ABC News the U.S. had tested over 3,600 people. And a spokesperson for HHS, Azar\u2019s agency, told us on March 3 that the CDC had tested samples from more than 1,200 patients.\n\n\"I don't know how to track U.S. tests any more,\" Lipsitch said.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar speaks at the White House about the coronavirus on Feb. 28, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Vucci)\n\nThe CDC stopped posting testing data as more state and local public-health labs have been brought into the fold, said Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, said during a March 3 briefing.\n\n\"With more and more testing done at states, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally,\" she said.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told us that the department doesn\u2019t know how many additional tests have been administered by those state and local labs, adding that those labs can now test up to 15,000 people and are expected to be able to test as many as 75,000 people by March 6.\n\nThe U.S. test count should rise into the millions as IDT, a commercial manufacturer, and other commercial and academic labs begin producing their own tests soon, according to HHS.\n\nWhy the United States lagged behind\n\nThe government\u2019s initial testing effort was hindered by flaws with the CDC\u2019s early test kits and restrictions that had limited which labs could run the tests and which patients could be tested.\n\nWhen the first U.S. coronavirus was detected, the country brushed aside the WHO test used by other nations and leaned on the CDC to develop and mass produce a more complicated test capable of detecting other viruses in addition to the coronavirus, according to reports.\n\nThe test kits went out in early February. But some state labs that received them reported that flaws in the tests were triggering inconclusive results. Those states had to ship samples out to the CDC\u2019s offices in Atlanta for results until the CDC fixed the problem weeks later.\n\nSince then, the Food and Drug Administration has given labs and hospitals across the country the go-ahead to administer their own tests before the FDA finishes reviewing them, so long as those tests are proven to work. That should lead to more testing, experts said.\n\nThe CDC also modified its screening criteria to expand testing for some people with severe respiratory symptoms who did not travel to China or come into known contact with a coronavirus patient. Previously, travel to China or exposure to the virus were preconditions for screening.\n\nAdequate testing is essential to getting an accurate count of U.S. cases, experts said.\n\nTesting is also key for treating patients and identifying people who might be infected but don\u2019t show symptoms, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n\"The latest data suggests the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as a couple of weeks,\" Watanabe said.\n\nDespite the recent acceleration, Lipsitch said U.S. testing is happening \"very slowly and at a level that is still paltry\" compared with some other countries.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDobbs said that the United States is \"actually screening fewer people (for the coronavirus than other countries) because we don\u2019t have appropriate testing.\"\n\nExperts told us that to date, the United States has lagged behind other countries, though numbers are imprecise. An error with the CDC\u2019s early test kits contributed to the United States\u2019 relatively low screening numbers. The administration has taken steps to make testing more widely available.\n\nWith that additional information, we rate Dobbs\u2019 statement Mostly True.", "date": "2020/03/02", "false_statement": " The United States is \u201cactually screening fewer people (for the coronavirus than other countries) because we don\u2019t have appropriate testing.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " The CDC has stopped publicly reporting the number of tests it\u2019s administered.

There\u2019s plenty of science behind social distancing.\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham falsely claimed on her TV show that there\u2019s \"no real scientific basis\" behind social distancing, the practice of keeping distance from others to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.\n\n\"Although intuitively I think it probably seemed like social distancing would be necessary, there was no real scientific basis for believing that, since it had never been studied,\" Ingraham said.\n\nAmericans have widely followed social distancing directives to \"flatten the curve\" of new coronavirus cases and prevent hospitals from being stretched beyond capacity. In the absence of widespread testing, most Americans have supported such mitigation efforts.\n\nBut scattered protests have also captured attention and led pundits like Ingraham and fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson to call for an end to more statewide shutdowns as U.S. deaths due to the coronavirus top 70,000.\n\nMembers of the White House coronavirus task force have encouraged social distancing. President Donald Trump credited nationwide closures with saving \"millions of lives\" as recently as May 3 in a town hall.\n\nBut while it\u2019s difficult to assess the exact impact of social distancing policies so far, experts told us Ingraham\u2019s claim is wrong. There\u2019s plenty of science behind social distancing.\n\n\"It\u2019s one of the few tools that we know works in the case of an unknown, novel virus such as this,\" said Thomas Novotny, an epidemiologist at San Diego State University.\n\nFox News did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nStudies of the 1918 influenza are informative\n\nWith the coronavirus still running its course, studies on the impact of mitigation efforts are only just emerging. But past respiratory disease outbreaks have been informative, experts said.\n\nOn her show, Ingraham cited a recent study on the effects of lockdowns in western Europe and a clip of Stanford University biologist Michael Levitt calling European lockdowns a \"mistake.\"\n\nShe also highlighted a recent CBS News interview in which Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said mitigation \"didn\u2019t work as well as we expected.\"\n\nGottlieb has himself encouraged social distancing, however. And the study of European countries, which hasn\u2019t yet been peer reviewed, doesn\u2019t say social distancing is futile, but rather that social distancing measures \"have approximately the same effects\" as full lockdowns.\n\n\"My work does not question the efficiency of social distancing,\" said Thomas Meunier, the researcher behind the study.\n\nCharles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University, said social distancing \"is a fundamental way to interrupt the transmission of disease in populations.\"\n\n\"To say that there was no scientific basis for believing that is like saying there is no scientific basis for epidemiology,\" he said.\n\nThe concept of limiting person-to-person contact dates back centuries. But non-pharmaceutical interventions, as the practices we associate with social distancing are known, became official U.S. policy under President George W. Bush in 2007, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe shift came after researchers looked back at government responses to the 1918 influenza, which killed about 675,000 Americans. Elaine Nsoesie, assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said that pandemic saw many social distancing measures put in place, including bans on gatherings and school closures.\n\nRELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing\n\nOne study in the Journal of the American Medical Association examined social distancing in 43 cities for about 24 weeks in 1918 and 1919. It found cities suffered less when they implemented social distancing swiftly, comprehensively and for a sustained period of time.\n\nA second study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on 17 U.S. cities. It found those with early, layered interventions had flatter epidemic curves and peak death rates about 50% lower than cities that didn\u2019t take similar steps.\n\nThose findings became the basis for the policies adopted by the Bush administration and later modified under President Barack Obama.\n\nStudies of the 1918 pandemic \"indicated that early implementation of multiple social distancing interventions was associated with a lower death rate at the peak of the epidemic,\" Nsoesie said.\n\nDavid Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, told us Ingraham\u2019s claim is incorrect: \"Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been shown to help reduce the overall number of cases and virus-related mortality.\"\n\nThat\u2019s because shrinking gatherings \"should lead to less exposure to potentially infected individuals and thus reduce the potential for transmission,\" Hamer said.\n\nOther evaluations of social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and related interventions have been compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially as they relate to influenza pandemics. (See page 23 of this 2017 CDC document, for example.)\n\nNow more than ever, it\u2019s important to sort fact from fiction. Please donate to support our mission.\n\nSocial distancing and COVID-19\n\nWhat we know about COVID-19 also suggests that social distancing works, experts said.\n\nHamer cited the Imperial College of London's projection that the U.S. could see up to 2.2 million COVID-19 deaths if it did nothing to slow the spread, as well as a not-yet-peer-reviewed study from Swiss researchers that estimated the impact of various interventions on new cases.\n\nThe Swiss researchers said non-pharmaceutical interventions contributed to \"a strong overall reduction\" in new cases, with venue closures, border closures, work-from-home policies and limits on large gatherings having the highest impact.\n\nThe coronavirus spreads mainly among people in close contact, through respiratory droplets launched into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, according to the CDC.\n\n\"Those droplets, as they\u2019re falling out of the air, someone else may inhale them or get them into their mouth or their eyes,\" said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Lauren Sauer on a university podcast. \"And that\u2019s why you have to be less than 6 feet away to really be at risk.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIngraham said \"there was no real scientific basis for believing that\" social distancing would be necessary, \"since it had never been studied.\"\n\nExperts we spoke to cited a number of studies \u2014 including two influential analyses of the 1918 influenza \u2014 that show social distancing can help slow the spread of new infectious diseases.\n\nWe rate this statement False.", "date": "2020/05/04", "false_statement": " \u201cThere was no real scientific basis for believing that\u201d social distancing would be necessary, \u201csince it had never been studied.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Experts in public health and epidemiology said Ingraham\u2019s claim is wrong.

Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?\" stated a May 27 Facebook post by the New Florida Majority, a liberal group.

While some of the numbers in the post are in the ballpark, the way Squire compared them creates a misleading picture.\n\nRELATED: COVID-19 skeptics say there\u2019s an overcount. Doctors in the field say the opposite\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nHow the CDC codes pneumonia and COVID deaths\n\nSquire, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, told us he drew his information from a Reddit thread showing death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe r/coronavirus thread said Florida\u2019s pneumonia deaths were in the 900 range between 2015 and 2018, but jumped above 4,000 this year. Squire ran with those numbers for his tweet, pulling in CDC estimates for Florida deaths from COVID-19 and pneumonia this year. (The data for 2019 has not yet been finalized.)\n\nBut that comparison doesn\u2019t work, said Bob Anderson, the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch in the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. The issue is the way causes of death are coded in CDC data.\n\nIf the death certificate mentions both COVID-19 and pneumonia, both codes are included in CDC data for the current year, and the death will be allocated to both categories in the CDC\u2019s provisional surveillance system, which keeps a rough running tally of deaths in a given year. In 2021, when the CDC finalizes the data and reports national statistics for 2020 cases, it will focus on the underlying cause of death, and assign only one cause to each death. In a case where both pneumonia and COVID-19 are reported on the death certificate, the underlying cause will almost always be COVID-19, Anderson said.\n\nIn recent years, the number of Florida residents whose underlying cause of death was pneumonia was in the 900s through this point in the year. (When Anderson looked at a separate category of deaths that occurred in Florida, which includes residents and visitors, the numbers were slightly higher.)\n\nFor the 5,185 figure that Squire tweeted, \"many of them actually are pneumonia due to COVID-19, or pneumonia due to other conditions such as influenza,\" Anderson said. \"But the fact is those with pneumonia due to COVID-19 would be counted in both COVID-19 and pneumonia category\" in the provisional data.\n\nSo what these posts did was take the 900 figure, which referred to cases in recent years where pneumonia is the underlying cause of death, and compare that to a broader category of cases this year where pneumonia is mentioned on a death certificate, data which is provisional at this point.\n\nThat said, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's leading infectious-disease specialist, and other medical experts have said the government\u2019s COVID-19 death toll is an undercount. There are several reasons why a COVID-19 death might not be reported as such, including that a test was not available or that the person died at home.\n\n\"It is likely we are underestimating the number of deaths at this point from COVID-19, but it\u2019s going to vary from state to state,\" Anderson said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the New Florida Majority, which posted the claim on Facebook, pointed to an article by The Daily Beast about undercounting of COVID deaths in Florida and elsewhere.\n\nFlorida\u2019s public data reporting about COVID-19 deaths has drawn scrutiny. In May, a state Department of Health employee said she was pressured to manipulate data and was fired. A spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis said the employee had been insubordinate and the state denied any manipulation of the data. However, county medical examiners have reported higher death counts than the state.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post said, \"According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia. Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?\"\n\nEach number here stems from actual data, but the post makes comparisons between them that are misleading. Pneumonia deaths in Florida are up this year compared with some recent years, but the tweet ignores that the CDC\u2019s provisional data for this year counts some deaths for now as being caused by both pneumonia and COVID-19. Finalized 2020 data released next year will list only one underlying cause of death.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "date": "2020/05/27", "false_statement": " \u201cAccording to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia.

The single underlying cause is reflected in finalized year-end data issued the following year. The deaths in the 900 range refer to cases where pneumonia was the final underlying cause of death. But the number cited for 2020 includes deaths where pneumonia is one of the causes listed on the death certificate. Government officials have said that the national data on COVID-19 deaths is likely an undercount."}

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWith fewer than 300 reported cases and zero deaths, Vietnam has been highlighted for its response to COVID-19, which included strict quarantining and intensive testing. Much of the country has reopened, with children returning to school May 4.\n\nWhile Vietnam has grappled with real issues related to animal welfare, experts we spoke to say they haven\u2019t found widespread evidence that black cats are being killed and turned into a paste to treat COVID-19.\n\nThe news service that generated the story said it has removed the article from circulation amid concerns about its credibility.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know.\n\nOn April 17, The Sun, a tabloid in the United Kingdom and Ireland, published a story that reported on an investigation by an animal rights group called Four Paws. According to the story, the group said it examined dining app data and found that dog and cat meat sales were surging through dining app delivery services in Cambodia and Vietnam. The story surmised that \"doctors in the region are encouraging many to eat dog and cat meat, claiming its properties help fight off viruses.\"\n\nA week later, on April 23 and 24, stories credited to the South West News Service were published elsewhere that had a similar storyline, but took the claim further to suggest black cats are being singled out, turned into paste and consumed as medicine.\n\nPictures credited to South West News Service accompanied some versions of the online stories. But the captions were vague and the images hard to verify. They included, for example, a photo of a baby drinking from a bottle that appears to contain a black substance. \"This distressing image shows a baby reportedly being fed the black cat concoction,\" the caption said.\n\nThe stories\u2019 only source appeared to be the head of another charity, No to Dog Meat, based in London. We reached out to that group for evidence. They sent us to their YouTube account which includes four videos uploaded in April and May that claim in captions or titles to show cat mistreatment in Vietnam but which included no verifiable information about exactly where or when they were taken.\n\nAsked about the black cat claim, Cat Besch, founder and director of Hanoi-based Vietnam Animal Aid & Rescue, told PolitiFact she has seen \"zero evidence in Vietnam so far that this is true.\"\n\nNam Nguyen, an editor in Vietnam with the government-run Vietnam News Agency, told PolitiFact \"the rumor has been around these weeks and originated from one post in Thailand social media, but as far as I know, Vietnamese are not so superstitious like other nations in southeast Asia to practice those ancient rites.\" He said the post has been deleted.\n\nPhuong Tham, director of Human Society International in Vietnam, told PolitiFact that black cats are being killed there \"by people with lack of knowledge, believing that black cats' bones can treat asthma in children, while others kill them for superstitious beliefs,\" but \"we have seen no evidence that black cats in Vietnam are being killed for COVID-19 treatment.\"\n\nTham and Dr. Todd Pollack, Harvard University medical professor and country director in Hanoi of the Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam, said it is significant that they had not seen the claim reported by news organizations in Vietnam.\n\nVN Express, a newspaper in Vietnam, reported that on May 6, police in Nghe An province seized 630 kilograms of dog, cat carcasses and entrails of other animals from a passenger bus. The driver said the meat was being taken to Hanoi for consumption, according to the report. But the report contains no suggestion the meat was being used for treatment of coronavirus.\n\nWhen we reached out to South West News Service about the source of the information, the agency told PolitiFact that \"shortly after publication, we identified a number of issues with this story and pulled it from our service. We received new information which led us to doubt the widespread nature of the claims the charity had made on this issue.\"\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "date": "2020/04/24", "false_statement": " Black cats in Vietnam are being killed and consumed as a COVID-19 cure.\t\t", "true_statement": " Cat meat is consumed in Vietnam, but there is no evidence of widespread killing and consuming of black cats as a treatment for COVID-19.

Illinois reported its first death on March 17, a patient who was a Chicago resident.\n\nThe most recent available numbers on deaths in Chicago come from the Cook County Medical Examiner, which takes cases that require additional investigation to determine a cause of death. If someone was under the care of a doctor when they died, that case wouldn\u2019t necessarily go to the medical examiner because the doctor can sign off on their death certificate.\n\nSo it\u2019s important to note that information from the medical examiner doesn\u2019t encompass all deaths in Chicago. But it does provide a valuable snapshot.\n\nThe examiner\u2019s office handled 413 deaths in Chicago in March, according to its case archive as of April 2. At least 11 of them were tied to COVID-19, while other causes of death ranged from gunshot wounds to cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn March 2019, by comparison, the medical examiner saw 279 deaths in Chicago. There were 301 Chicago cases in March 2018 and 306 in March 2017.\n\nThese numbers show the virus doesn\u2019t appear to be decreasing deaths as the Facebook post suggested. Instead, officials say it's likely the opposite.\n\n\"The uptick you are seeing is a direct correlation to the rise in COVID-19 cases,\" said Natalia Derevyanny, director of communications for the Cook County Bureau of Administration.\n\nThe homicide question\n\nChicago sees high rates of gun violence largely tied to gang conflict. Given its reputation, this Facebook post implies that the virus is ultimately saving lives because people are inside and not on the streets.\n\nThe poster did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Police Department, the city saw 24 homicides in March, a decrease from 35 in March of last year. But shootings and shooting victims for the month jumped roughly 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThe department declined to say whether it attributes the decrease in homicides to COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been hesitant to draw a line between the virus and crime.\n\n\"We can\u2019t specifically say that the crime rate is affected by coronavirus,\" Lightfoot said. \"But obviously what we know going back many, many years and looking at data is that when large congregations of people are outside in neighborhoods where gun violence is prevalent, that increases the risk.\"\n\nA footnote: In Milwaukee \u2014 another city plagued by gun violence \u2014 there were more homicides in March 2020 than March 2019, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s homicide tracker.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post shared by more than 2,000 people claimed that in Chicago, COVID-19 has lowered the death rate.\n\nBut numbers from the Cook County Medical Examiner do not indicate that deaths in Chicago decreased in March as COVID-19 started to ravage Illinois. In fact, the data suggest the opposite \u2014 more deaths, despite a decrease in murders reported by Chicago police.\n\nWe rate the claim False.", "date": "2020/03/22", "false_statement": " \u201cIn Chicago, COVID-19 actually lowered the death rate.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Deaths in Chicago increased in March 2020 compared to previous years, despite a decline in murders."}

But it depends on age, general health, other symptoms and other factors.\n\nA fever makes it harder for some viruses to survive, but it\u2019s not yet known whether that\u2019s true for the novel coronavirus.\n\nIf you\u2019re a mostly healthy person who contracts the coronavirus, will letting your fever run high help get rid of it?\n\nThat\u2019s what a post shared on Facebook suggests. It says:\n\n\"Passing along corona advise from a retired respiratory therapist\" for \"the otherwise generally healthy population.\"\n\nIt lists eight recommendations, starting with:\n\n\"For people experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis. \u2026 Only high temperatures kill a virus, so let your fever run high. \u2026 Use common sense and don't let fever go over 103 or 104 if you got the guts.\"\n\nThe final recommendation is: \"If your still dying go to ER.\" (Yes, it says, \"advise\" instead of \"advice\" and \"your\" instead of \"you\u2019re\" in the post.)\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ll first note that it\u2019s best to take your medical advice from health care professionals, not from random Facebook posts.\n\nDoctors say it\u2019s true that a high temperature can help the body fight off a virus, but not enough is known about the new coronavirus to support the post\u2019s advice, and running a high fever could be dangerous.\n\nWhat is a fever?\n\nA fever means you have a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFevers are a common sign of illness, but they also play a key role in fighting infections.\n\nGenerally speaking, a fever is \"basically a symptom of your immune system trying to fight the virus\" Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact. \"The higher temperature does make it more difficult for some viruses to survive.\"\n\nThe Mayo Clinic offers general tips \u2014 for otherwise healthy people and not specifically for coronavirus \u2014 on deciding whether to treat a fever or let it run its course. For example, for adults with a temperature above 102, Mayo recommends acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or aspirin.\n\nBut it says treatment decisions also depend on age, medical history, other symptoms and other factors, not just temperature.\n\nFever and the coronavirus\n\nFever, along with cough and shortness of breath, is among the symptoms of COVID-19. If you have symptoms and think you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your healthcare provider, the CDC advises.\n\nCDC\u2019s Self-Checker tool can help you make decisions about seeking medical care. Mayo Clinic also offers a tool that helps you decide on seeking medical care and whether you need a COVID-19 test.\n\nIf you\u2019ll be treating COVID-19 symptoms at home, get enough rest, stay well-hydrated, and take medications to relieve fever and aches and pains, Harvard Medical School says.\n\nFor fever, aches and pains, the school recommends acetaminophen. But if you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and doses, and make sure not to exceed a total of 3,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day.\n\nMayo Clinic recommends rest and fluids, as well as cough medication, and pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\n\nThere have been some claims that using ibuprofen to treat coronavirus symptoms is risky. We found that some medical experts believe ibuprofen\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties could damp the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off COVID-19. But experts say this is just a theory and that there\u2019s no scientific evidence that links ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medications with COVID-19 complications.\n\nThat said, there is no rule that says you need to lower a fever with over-the-counter medication if you\u2019re feeling only mild symptoms and are not uncomfortable, Consumer Reports says in an article on COVID-19 and fevers. It lists a cold compress for sweating and blankets for chills, along with rest and liquids, as alternatives.\n\nThe article says there is an argument for letting a fever run its course, because lowering a fever with medication might suppress your body\u2019s ability to fend off illness, \"but if your fever is running at or above 103 degrees, you should call a doctor. A high fever could lead to a seizure or brain damage.\"\n\nDr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases, told PolitiFact that while there is research suggesting that fever can defend against infection, \"it is extremely difficult to relate the magnitude of fever to the severity of infection, or to demonstrate the benefits of fever for any given microorganism,\" including the COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe body\u2019s immune response is the most important factor in killing the virus, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician-scientist at the University of Maryland. \"The fever response is just one of the symptoms that are experienced when the immune response is revved up when fighting the virus.

John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two.\n\nKennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was \"under 2%\" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that \"it changes daily.\" The Louisiana senator then asked, \"What\u2019s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?\"\n\nWolf answered: \"It\u2019s also right around that percentage as well. I don\u2019t have that offhand, but it\u2019s right around 2% as well.\"\n\nWe asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf\u2019s figure came from.\n\nA DHS spokesperson said in an email, \"As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response.\"\n\nThe comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up. We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk.\n\nDigging into mortality rate numbers\n\nThe CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus.\n\nChristopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it \"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\"\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually.\n\nNow, for coronavirus.\n\nAccording to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary\u2019s testimony.)\n\nBut this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus.\n\n\"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\" said Mores. \"They have changed their case definitions multiple times. It\u2019s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.\"\n\nThe WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%.\n\nMike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%.\n\nRight now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. \"We don\u2019t have any evidence to that being the case,\" said Osterholm.\n\nMores said U.S. health officials just don\u2019t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar. Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus. It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness.\n\n\"Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it\u2019s going to be pretty squishy. So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,\" he said. \"Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don\u2019t know yet.\"\n\nMultiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"confirmed cases.\"\n\nUntil the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down.\n\nThis is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis.\n\nOne key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness.\n\nMores concurred. \"You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we\u2019re all susceptible to it. Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,\" he said. \"Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThere are two ways to parse out this claim: First, is it true that the average U.S. mortality rate for flu is 2%?\n\nThat\u2019s not true, according to data from the CDC and exchanges with multiple global health experts. On average, the flu mortality rate during the past 10 years has been 0.1%. In addition, Wolf and a DHS spokesperson admitted that the acting secretary did not have the statistics in front of him when he answered questions at the hearing about the mortality rates.\n\nSecond, is it true the COVID-19 mortality rate is similar to the flu mortality rate?\n\nWolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That\u2019s vastly different from the flu\u2019s mortality rate of 0.1%.\n\nExperts also said that while it\u2019s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu\u2019s mortality rate eventually \u2015 if the case definition of coronavirus is expanded -- it\u2019s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.\n\nFor these reasons, we rate the claim False.", "date": "2020/02/25", "false_statement": " The mortality rate for the flu is \u201cright around\u201d that of the new coronavirus: \u201cIt\u2019s right around 2%.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " The mortality rate for the flu is considered by most experts to be about 0.1%. Estimates for the mortality rate for coronavirus are currently around 2%, but this number could change depending on how cases are diagnosed."}

Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect,\" Trump tweeted April 13. \"It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet comes as he weighs whether to extend his stay-at-home guidelines, which expire April 30, a decision he has described as \"the biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make.\"\n\nReopening businesses, schools and public facilities is a decision with major implications for public health, the economy and education. But Trump\u2019s tweet is misleading because governors do have power to shut down \u2014 and reopen \u2014 businesses and public spaces in their state.\n\nTrump has traded barbs with governors during the pandemic, especially over where responsibility lies in securing medical supplies for the states. But governors have largely made their own calls about what to close down.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that governors pushed back against Trump\u2019s comments on who has authority to \"open up the states.\"\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, said on CNN: \"Governors made decisions to take various actions in their states based on what they thought was right for their states, based on the facts on the ground, talking with doctors and scientists. And I think individual governors who made those decisions will have the ultimate decision about what to do with their states.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said on CNN that \"all these orders are executive state orders, so therefore it would be up to the state and governor to undo all of that.\"\n\nWe contacted the White House to ask for evidence behind Trump\u2019s claim and did not get a reply.\n\nGovernors have power to issue closures\n\nOn March 16, Trump issued guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19, which included recommendations on social distancing and to \"listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.\"\n\nBut it was the governors who issued more specific directives that closed non-essential businesses and many other facilities, such as schools, bars, swimming pools and beaches.\n\nMany legal experts and political scientists have said that governors have the authority to make such decisions.\n\nStates provide licenses for businesses and hold the primary responsibility for making decisions about public health.\n\n\"The simple answer is governors have way more legal authority than the president of the United States to make these decisions about closing and opening facilities, closing and opening the economy,\" said David Schultz, professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University.\n\nUniversity of Texas law professor Robert Chesney told PolitiFact that Trump has no inherent or statutory authority to command the governors to change shelter-in-place or business-shutdown orders.\n\nWhile federal powers are supreme, they are limited in scope, Chesney wrote in the Lawfare Blog in March. State governments are independent entities, not mere subordinate layers underneath the federal government, he wrote.\n\n\"The federal government cannot commandeer the machinery of the state governments (or, by extension, of local governments),\" Chesney wrote. \"That is, the federal government cannot coerce the states into taking actions to suit federal policy preference. \u2026 And so, the federal government cannot compel state and local officials to promulgate different rules on social distancing and the like.\"\n\nNo existing federal law \u2014 including the Public Health Service Act and the Stafford Act \u2014 can be read to confer such authority on the president, Chesney wrote. And there is little chance that this Congress will pass a law that gives Trump power to override state and local rules.\n\nJames Hodge Jr., a health law professor at Arizona State University, said the president can\u2019t simply command states to re-open.\n\n\"He can strongly encourage, advise, or even litigate whether states\u2019 authorities to restrict public movements re: shelter in place or stay home orders are warranted, but cannot tell sovereign governors to lift these orders all at once just because the federal government determines it is high time to do so,\" he told PolitiFact in an email.\n\nThere are other ways Trump could pressure governors, tweeted University of Texas law school professor Steve Vladeck. He could pull emergency funding, or call the federal workforce back into work, Vladeck listed as examples. Still, most action has been taken by local authorities.\n\nWendy K. Mariner, Boston University health law professor, said the governors have the authority to end their closure orders, though that isn\u2019t the same as ordering them to reopen, which some may not be able to afford to do. Also, in most states, the state legislature can end the emergency declaration if the governor keeps it going beyond the period specified by statute.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet raises some practical implications.

We\u2019re worried about our health. So why is Trump still trying to cut our Medicare? $451 billion in cuts in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Trump is putting us at risk,\" the commercial\u2019s narrator says.\n\nThe PAC, which was formed in 2011 to support President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, has been tapped by Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, as his preferred choice among Democratic super PACS for big-donor giving.\n\nThis ad caught our attention for two reasons. First, the term \"Medicare cuts\" has long been volleyed between both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House \u2014 and often has proven to be a powerful political tool.\n\nSecond, the connection between \"cuts\" to Medicare and the coronavirus pandemic was a new concept we wanted to explore.\n\nWe reached out to Priorities USA Action to ask for the basis of these statements.\n\nJosh Schwerin, a PAC spokesperson, sent us a links to news articles and confirmed that the \"$451 billion in cuts\" referred to Trump\u2019s 2021 proposed budget for Medicare.\n\nAsked to pinpoint where the $451 billion came from, Schwerin pointed us to a February ABC News article that said the president\u2019s budget plan would \"whack away at federal spending on health care over the next 10 years ... including $451 billion less spent on Medicare.\" He also sent us links to a February Washington Blade article and February press release from Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) \u2014 both of which also cited that figure.\n\nCuts or a reduction in spending? An argument that\u2019s been around\n\nIn fall 2010, a few months after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Republicans aired midterm campaign ads attacking Democrats for \"cutting\" or \"gutting\" Medicare. The reason was the law included a $500 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare over 10 years, which would be used to help fund the ACA.\n\nThe Obama administration said the reductions in spending would come from lowering payments to Medicare Advantage plans and providers and would not affect the level of care that Medicare beneficiaries received. They also said it would help make the Medicare system more financially stable.\n\nNow, almost 10 years later, Democrats are using the same language to criticize the White House\u2019s long-term plan for Medicare spending.\n\n\"\u2018Cuts\u2019 is a term that has been thrown around for many years,\" said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This is a semantic issue that often gets politicized, often in an election year.\" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation).\n\nNeuman explained that what is being considered here is a reduction in the projected increase in spending over a certain period. This reduction is based on estimates of how much the government is projected to spend on programs \u2014 factoring in proposed policy changes \u2014 for the following 10 years, taking into account current levels of spending, assumptions about economic growth and trends in use of Medicare coverage, said Neuman.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2021 budget blueprint for Medicare estimated that spending would increase each of the 10 years. But the estimate also suggested that the administration\u2019s proposed policy changes would reduce the spending increase compared with estimates of what would be spent if the changes were not implemented.\n\n\"Let\u2019s say Medicare spends $100 in 2020 and is projected to spend $200 in 2021,\" Neuman said. \"If the budget said we\u2019re going to reduce the growth in spending by $25, that's a reduction in an increase. But other people might call that a cut.\"\n\nThe number itself and what it means\n\nWe reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, for its take on that $451 billion figure, but have not heard back.\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the actual figure could be anywhere from $400 billion to $600 billion, depending on how calculations are done. His analysis relied on the executive branch\u2019s Office of Management and Budget calculations and landed on a figure close to $505 billion. Other variables, such as \"likely savings from drug price reform\" \u2014 yet to be enacted \u2014 move it closer to $600 billion.\n\nThe left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came up with a similar estimate: $501 billion. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate not including savings generated from proposed drug pricing reforms was closer to $400 billion.\n\nIn all cases, though, the reductions in Medicare spending would be achieved through proposals such as lowering payments to providers and paying the same amount for the same health service offered in different settings, among other things.\n\nGoldwein said these proposals for Medicare reform are largely bipartisan and \"either mimic or build upon\" those advanced during the Obama era. He also said that, in his organization\u2019s view, the \"cuts\" are savings to the Medicare program and beneficiaries, who would see lower premiums and out-of-pocket medical costs.\n\nThe policy experts said it\u2019s likely the reductions in spending wouldn\u2019t directly affect the care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. But provider groups have complained that lower reimbursements might drive some doctors to leave Medicare. Hospitals have argued against the proposal for equalizing payments for similar services because they say their overhead expenses are higher than those of a doctor\u2019s office or off-site clinic and their higher rates help finance other necessary services.\n\nTiming matters\n\nThe Priorities USA Action ad also alleges that Trump is trying to cut Medicare \"in the middle of a deadly pandemic.\" But the timeline of events doesn\u2019t support this statement.\n\nThe White House released the 2021 budget proposal on Feb. 10 \u2014 well before the COVID-19 outbreak had become a part of our national consciousness.\n\nThe first domestic case of COVID-19 was announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 21. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus a \"public health emergency of international concern\" on Jan. 30.\n\nOn Feb. 10, the day the budget was released, the CDC put out a press release stating there were 13 cases of the disease in the U.S. CNN also published an article that day stating the vast majority of COVID-19 cases and deaths had occurred in China. Authorities didn\u2019t announce the first U.S. death from COVID-19 until Feb. 29. The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11.\n\n\"These budget proposals were probably developed well before the pandemic hit the U.S. and hit it hard,\" said Neuman. However, she added, \"the administration hasn\u2019t disavowed these proposals, but they also haven\u2019t pushed them forward.\"\n\nJoseph Antos, a scholar in health care and retirement policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said it was a \"ridiculous statement to connect cutting Medicare spending to the COVID crisis.\"\n\n\"The implication of the video that this is going on actively while we\u2019re in the middle of this crisis, that\u2019s dead wrong,\" said Antos.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Priorities ad said Trump is trying to make $451 billion in Medicare cuts \"in the middle of a deadly pandemic.\"\n\nThis is an exaggerated attack, even before the pandemic is layered on top of it. The dollar figure itself is \"in the ballpark\" of what the policy proposals would generate in spending reductions, giving this ad a sliver of truth. However, in the Trump budget, the amount is spread out over ten years -- important context that was omitted.\n\nWhat\u2019s in Trump\u2019s budget proposal is not a direct cut to Medicare benefits. Instead, Priorities uses the age-old political tactic \u2014 employed on both sides of the aisle \u2014 of holding up a reduction in projected spending growth as a \"cut.\"\n\nMoreover, the ad leaves the impression that Trump is trying to whack Medicare for seniors at a time when panic is particularly high because of the coronavirus. But that connection to the pandemic is also misleading. The presidential budget was released weeks before most of the nation began to comprehend the threat of COVID-19.\n\nThe claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and context that would give a different impression.

It\u2019s as safe as an environment as you\u2019re going to find,\" said Kelly.\n\nWe thought it was important to check this claim. After all, as states lift stay-at-home orders and summer weather starts to roll in, Americans are bound to start thinking about travel and whether it\u2019s safe to fly in the COVID age.\n\nWe contacted Southwest Airlines to ask for the evidence to back up Kelly\u2019s claim. A company spokesperson pointed us to this statement -- the Southwest Promise \u2013 which outlines steps taken by the airline to protect employees and customers from COVID-19. The spokesperson also said that all of Southwest\u2019s flights are equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which also are used in hospitals to provide patients with clean air.\n\nAll in all, it seems Kelly has some valid points about the safety of airplanes right now. But he also overplayed his hand.\n\nA matter of space\n\nSo, how might someone contract COVID-19 on a plane?\n\nAs with any setting that holds many people at the same time, there is a risk of virus transmission through the air as well as from high-touch surfaces. On an airplane, that could be a bathroom door handle. And it is easy to picture how this risk can be amplified on a long flight with other travelers.\n\nCase studies have shown that disease transmission occurs on flights. In 2003, for instance, 16 people tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS \u2013 a coronavirus closely related to COVID, after flying on a plane with a symptomatic passenger. The H1N1 virus, or swine flu, has also been documented as having spread between plane passengers. COVID-specific research is ongoing.\n\nThere are specific issues concerning air travel.\n\nQingyan Chen, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who led Federal Aviation Administration-sponsored research examining infectious disease transmission on airplanes, said his team focused on certain specific ways an illness could spread on an aircraft: by direct contact with sick person, and by inhaling large droplets or aerosols expelled from a sick person.\n\nLarge droplets are caused by forcing air out of your mouth, such as by breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing. A lot of the droplets are too large to stay airborne long, while others are very small and can stay airborne for hours. The small droplets are called aerosols.\n\nThough the air in an airplane is highly circulated, Chen said aerosols can still hang in the air for about three to four minutes before being sucked up by the ventilation system.\n\nAerosols \"can be really dangerous. They have the highest risk,\" said Chen. \"The small droplets can get to the seven rows around a sick passenger within four minutes.\" However, Chen was quick to point out that his studies were focused on other airborne diseases, like flu, tuberculosis and SARS.\n\nAirlines maintain that there is little evidence that COVID-19 transmission has occurred on planes and that their ventilation systems are 99.9% effective at filtering out microscopic particles. There are also studies that suggest aerosols have a more limited reach, just two seats laterally and one row in front of and one row behind an infectious passenger.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines from 120 countries, sent us details of a May 5 presentation by the group\u2019s medical adviser in which he referred to three \"studies\" \u2014 actually two academic journal research letters and a news article \u2014 that showed little or no transmission of COVID-19 on flights that contained passengers who had the coronavirus.\n\nOne of the letters, though, discussed a case in which a person flew from the Central African Republic to France and \"likely got infected on the plane.\"\n\n\"The research that\u2019s been done over the years is that there\u2019s really not any significant difference in what you would have in a building such as we\u2019re sitting in today, in terms of air quality,\" FAA chief Steve Dickson said at a March Capitol Hill hearing.\n\nAirlines for America, a U.S.-focused industry trade group, said the industry is \"taking substantial, proactive steps to protect passengers and employees,\" including requiring that passengers and employees wear masks, implementing intensive cleaning protocols and changing policies such as the boarding of passengers from back to front and the reduced frequency of food and beverage services. (Kelly is on the board of directors for Airlines for America.)\n\nDegrees of risk\n\nBut is that enough to justify Kelly\u2019s statement that airplanes are as safe as just about any other environment? Not really.\n\nThe key difference is that you are able to make decisions about how much space to put between yourself and other people in almost all other locations, said Karen Hoffmann, the immediate past president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.\n\n\"There are levels of what you can and can\u2019t do in an airplane,\" said Hoffmann. \"If you\u2019re in your home, you can maintain no one else coming into your space. In the grocery store you can walk away from other people.\"\n\nChen agreed. \"In offices, you have ample space to stay far apart and keep your social distancing,\" he said. \"But in the airplane, you cannot keep your social distance or else the airliners will not be profitable.\"\n\nHow do the infection-transmission risks of airplanes hold up in comparison with other modes of mass transportation?\n\n\"Compared to more cramped and less ventilated settings like subways and buses, the risks of getting sick on an airplane are lower overall \u2014 though you still face risk from whatever infections the people in your row may be carrying,\" wrote Rachel Vreeman in an email. She is the director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine.\n\nBut the research on this comparison predates COVID-19 and the impact of social distancing.\n\nThe longer average length of time passengers spend on airplanes versus mass transit could also make it less safe, Vreeman added.\n\nWith all of those factors taken into account, Kelly\u2019s statement unravels.\n\nIs an airplane potentially carrying an infectious passenger safer than your own home, where the only contact with a stranger you have is grabbing the takeout dinner order left on your porch by a delivery person? Clearly not.\n\nSo, what about that summer vacation?\n\nIt\u2019s clear that airlines do carry a transmission risk for illnesses like COVID-19, especially if you end up seated close to an infectious person. And people have less control over social distancing on airplanes than in other spaces.\n\nOverall, Chen said he thought it could be reasonably safe as long as every passenger and crew member wore a mask. He also suggested that passengers wipe down the surfaces around them and wash their hands, but said there would still be a risk.\n\nIn late April, unions representing pilots and flight attendants sent letters to the U.S. Transportation Department , the Department of Health and Human Services, Congress and the White House detailing the risks faced by airline workers \u2014 as well as the number of infections and even deaths they have suffered \u2014 and urging increased safety protections. Shortly after, most major U.S. airlines, including JetBlue, Frontier, American, Delta, United and Southwest, announced they would now require customers to wear face masks during check-in and boarding, in flight and while deplaning.\n\nHoffmann said that for a flight to be safe it would be crucial for social distancing rules to be in place, such as blocking out seats to space out travelers.\n\n\"Can you maintain that level of separation in an airplane?\" she asked. \"I question whether that is something which can be accomplished.\"\n\nDelta has started blocking out its middle seats. Some airlines are blocking the seats near where the flight attendants sit. United is not allowing customers to select seats next to each other or the middle seats. Both Southwest and JetBlue have said they will limit the number of passengers to ensure space between them.\n\nVreeman pointed out, though, that there are times on an airplane or in an airport where it might be impossible to maintain the appropriate distance from others.\n\n\"When someone is walking in the aisle to the bathroom, for example, you might be stuck in close proximity \u2014 and that would increase the risks to both of you,\" she wrote.\n\nAnd while all major U.S. airlines have announced increased efforts to disinfect and sanitize planes and eliminate or reduce food and beverage service, there is still a danger.\n\n\"Any time you are removing your mask or putting anything in your mouth, the risk of transmitting or being exposed to the virus will be higher,\" wrote Vreeman.\n\nAnd, Vreeman argued, we are still in the containment stage of the pandemic, which means moving from one place to another is itself a public health risk.\n\n\"At this moment in American history, it is still very possible that someone infected with this very contagious virus could be in that space on the airplane with you \u2014 or that you could be carrying the virus yourself to a new location,\" she wrote.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe CEO of Southwest Airlines said during a TV interview that the risks of COVID-19 transmission on an airplane are no greater than anywhere else and that \"it\u2019s as safe as an environment as you\u2019re going to find.\"\n\nResearch shows that airplanes\u2019 strong ventilation systems do filter out virus particles. However, studies also indicate that some level of risk regarding the transmission of an infectious disease persists, particularly if you are seated near a contagious person. And passengers\u2019 ability to take steps to mitigate that risk is limited.\n\nKelly\u2019s statement contained an element of truth regarding planes\u2019 air filtration and mitigation steps taken by the industry, but he took it a bit too far and left out key pieces of information and context.\n\nWe rate it as Mostly False.", "date": "2020/05/03", "false_statement": " Regarding the risks of coronavirus transmission on an airplane, \u201cIt\u2019s as safe as an environment as you\u2019re going to find.\u201d\t\t", "true_statement": " Studies show that infectious disease transmission can occur on airplanes, particularly if you are seated next to someone who is carrying an illness.

Many tweets and Facebook posts are making the false claim that there is a trend of disease outbreaks matched to elections.\n\n\"Every election year has a disease,\" reads one.\n\nThe posts connect SARS to 2004, avian flu to 2008, swine flu to 2010, MERS to 2012, Ebola to 2014 and 2018, Zika to 2016, and the coronavirus to 2020.\n\n\"Coincidences? NEVER.\"\n\nOne post we saw supposedly linked to the World Health Organization (WHO), but that lead to a 404 error page.\n\nOur research showed that most of these connections weren\u2019t real. We decided to take a closer look and see if the diseases were significant enough to appear in party platforms or mentioned during candidate interviews. In most cases, they weren\u2019t.\n\nOnline, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.\n\nSARS\n\nSARS is a coronavirus disease that spread from animals to humans and was diagnosed in China in 2003. SARS is a respiratory illness that affects breathing and is usually associated with coughing and a fever. It is spread through infected droplets that can survive on surfaces and could affect you if airborne.\n\nThe SARS outbreak was stopped by July 2003, and in 2004 China took precautions by putting an embargo on animals that could have been the source of the disease.\n\nSARS affected eight people in the United States, and all these cases were contracted from travel abroad. SARS did not spread within the United States during the 2003 outbreak, and there have been no cases reported since then.\n\nSARS wasn\u2019t a main campaign point in the 2004 presidential elections. It was referenced once in the Republican Party platform that was released in August 2004, under a section on international diplomacy that mentioned it as a joint concern of the United States and China.\n\nAvian flu\n\nAvian flu is usually found in aquatic birds and poultry, but in rare cases the influenza can cross over and infect humans. The symptoms of avian flu are like general influenza, including cough, fever, sore throat or headaches.\n\nThe two most prevalent avian influenza viruses, H5N1 and H9N2, caused respiratory infections in humans in China as early as the 1990s. Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Egypt, Thailand, and many other countries struggled with the spread of H5N1 from 2004 to 2014.\n\nIn 2014, there was only one case of H5N1 in North America, according to the CDC, and there were never any U.S. cases.\n\nAs far as the 2008 presidential campaign is concerned, the Democratic Party platform mentioned avian flu briefly to justify strengthening international support systems.\n\nNevertheless, the avian flu was a pandemic before the 2008 presidential election and has continued to be a problem even today, with new strains appearing as recently as 2017. The 2008 strain of the influenza had no significant influence on elections that we could determine.\n\nSwine flu\n\nThe swine flu, more specifically H1N1, started spreading in early 2009 and combined avian, swine, and human influenza in one new strain. The symptoms of the disease are like most flu symptoms, including a fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or a runny or stuffy nose. It also spreads like most influenza, with infected droplets that could be airborne or left on surfaces.\n\nThe 2009 swine flu outbreak was the \"first global flu pandemic in 40 years,\" according to the CDC. The panic surrounding swine flu led to many extreme measures, including school shutdowns and people camping outside of free swine flu vaccine centers. But not everyone approved of the vaccine.\n\nPolitiFact checked a statement from October 2009 by Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host who was against the swine flu vaccination. He believed the vaccine would lead to neurological problems like that of an influenza vaccine from the 1970s. We rated his statement Mostly False.\n\nSwine flu was a politically polarizing disease when it came to vaccinating and expanding the government\u2019s health budget to prevent more outbreaks. It affected Americans directly and led to preventative legislation, but we found no examples of representatives using H1N1 in their campaigns during the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nMERS\n\nThe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is a viral respiratory illness that was first found in dromedary (or one-humped) camels and then spread to humans. Most cases of the disease came from direct or in-direct contact with camels.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of MERS is more rare and mostly appears in unsanitary health care settings. Symptoms of the disease include fever, coughing, or trouble with breathing that can lead to pneumonia.\n\nMERS was first diagnosed in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the CDC. All cases of MERS in 2012 were within the Arabian Peninsula, with two unlinked cases only reaching the U.S. in 2014.\n\nMERS was not brought up by any campaigns or included in any party platforms in the 2012 presidential election. It didn\u2019t affect the U.S. until 2014, and even then the only comment was from press secretary Jay Carney, when he said at a press conference that President Barack Obama had \"been briefed\" on the MERS developments. Even though MERS did occur during the 2012 election, it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on U.S. politics.\n\nEbola\n\nThe Ebola virus emerged periodically and caused outbreaks in many African countries as early as 1995. Ebola is introduced into the human population when there is close contact with the bodily fluids of infected fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines. Human-to-human transmission only occurs when touching infected human bodily fluids or objects that have touched infected human bodily fluids.\n\nThe first signs of Ebola include fever, fatigue, or a sore throat. Later, the infected person will experience vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In the most deadly cases, there is internal and external bleeding.\n\nThe first large outbreaks were in 1995 and 2000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, according to the CDC\u2019s timeline.\n\nThe CDC also documented only four diagnosed Ebola cases in the U.S. in 2014, and only two of the Ebola patients were infected in the U.S. In 2018, there were only outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.\n\nIn 2014, an NPR report broke down how Ebola was used by both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDemocrats would use Ebola to \"argue that budget-cutting Republicans have deprived the government of the resources it needs to keep Americans safe.\" Republicans used the government\u2019s reaction to Ebola as an example of President Obama\u2019s \"incompetence\" and linked Ebola to border security.\n\nIn contrast, Ebola was not a topic in the 2018 election because Ebola was only concentrated in two African countries and had a very low chance of coming to the U.S. again, according to the Association of Health Care Journalists.\n\nEbola was not a huge threat to Americans in the United States despite some cases in 2014, but it was used as a political tool in the 2014 midterm elections. Comparatively, there were no cases of Ebola in 2018 in the United States, and it was not used as rhetoric in the elections.\n\nZika\n\nZika is spread mostly through the bite of infected mosquitoes, but can also be transmitted through unprotected sex. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, headache, joint and muscle pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). While Zika has a low death rate, it became a larger issue when it was linked to fetal brain defects in infected pregnant women\u2019s children.\n\nOutbreaks of the Zika virus have been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands since 1952, according to the CDC. It began to appear more in the United States in 2015 and 2016 because of people travelling from tropical climates and from local mosquitos in Texas and Florida. In 2016, the Zika outbreak hit a peak, with 5,168 symptomatic Zika virus disease cases reported in the U.S., according to the CDC\u2019s 2016 report.\n\nZika sowed division in an already divided Senate but didn\u2019t impact the presidential race. President Obama\u2019s administration asked Congress \"for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to enhance\u2026 efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus\" in February 2016.\n\nIt took almost seven months for Congress to approve a federal spending bill to prevent the Zika virus from spreading. The New York Times reported that they voted to advance the funding, despite disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on where the funding should come from. A month later, the bill had fallen apart, with the Democrats rejecting provisions added by the Republicans. Finally, the bill passed on Sept. 28, 2016, with concessions made by both sides.\n\nDuring this congressional tug of war, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both brought up the Zika virus only once during their campaigns. When Trump was asked about how he would deal with the Zika virus while he campaigned in Florida, he said that Rick Scott, the state\u2019s Republican governor, was doing a great job and \"he's going to have it under control, he probably already does.\" Clinton urged Congress to pass a spending bill and \"called for more public education about the virus\u2019 dangers, the development of a rapid diagnostic test, investment in treatment and a vaccine, better mosquito control and abatement, and improved access to health and family planning services.\"\n\nWhile the Zika virus had an impact on Americans in 2016 and showed how divided the Senate was, we found little impact on the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a respiratory disease that has symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is spread by airborne respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can also be spread by touching surfaces that droplets have landed on.\n\nLike it says in the name, COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has spread across the world as people traveled to and from China. There are now 647 cases in the U.S. as of March 10, 2020.\n\nAs COVID-19 has spread in the United States, Congress and President Donald Trump have approved funding to create a vaccine and prevent a pandemic. On March 6, 2020, Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill.\n\nThis time, the virus has been a major point of discussion for the president and other presidential candidates.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA post on social media says \"Every election year has a disease\" ... SARS in 2004; avian flu in 2008; swine flu in 2010; MERS in 2012; Ebola in 2014 and 2018; Zika in 2016 and the coronavirus in 2020.\n\nBut most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years. Some of the diseases never impacted the United States, and never came up as a large point in a campaign. There is some evidence that Ebola in 2014 impacted the election, but otherwise there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe post is not accurate.

The owner, Angela Marsden, had posted a viral video criticizing county officials for suspending outdoor dining.\n\nHannity later specified that he was talking about \"outside\" dining in California. But Ingraham\u2019s claim about restaurants was far more sweeping \u2014 and more wrong. It\u2019s inaccurate to say that \"there\u2019s no science\" to show \"restaurants are spreaders of COVID.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of information showing that restaurants are a high-risk environment,\" said Emily Landon, an epidemiologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"Anytime people congregate, there exist increased opportunities for transmission should someone be infected,\" added Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. \"A restaurant is no different.\"\n\nFox News did not offer comment for this fact-check.\n\nIndoor dining is most risky, studies suggest\n\nThe risks associated with dining out vary based on the safety precautions the restaurants take and the coronavirus situation in their geographic areas. Many restaurants have become safer over time, but case surges in many states make running into an infected person more likely.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to make universal claims because the pandemic is different in different parts of the country and even in different parts of the state,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \"In some parts of the country, restaurants aren\u2019t driving cases. In others, they have been identified in case investigations.\"\n\nCity data in Washington, D.C., for example, has shown restaurants and bars to be among the most common places for virus spread. Data in and around Los Angeles has been less clear.\n\nStill, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that COVID-19 has and can spread at restaurants \u2014 and especially at those that let groups of people congregate indoors without masks.\n\n\"Modeling studies have indicated that restaurants are high-risk environments for COVID-19 transmission,\" said Jason McDonald, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"In places like restaurants, people remove their masks to consume food and beverages, which increases the risk of transmission.\"\n\nOne CDC report in September, based on a survey of 314 symptomatic people who got tested for the coronavirus in July, found a link between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as restaurants.\n\nThe authors wrote that those with positive test results were \"approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant\" than those who tested negative.\n\nIn a November study published in Nature, researchers at Stanford University and Northwestern University analyzed anonymized cell phone mobility data from 10 U.S. cities from March to May.\n\nFull-service restaurants, gyms and other crowded places accounted for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections, the study\u2019s simulations showed. \"Restaurants were by far the riskiest places,\" Stanford\u2019s Jure Leskovec, an author of the report, told reporters in November.\n\nPatrons enjoy food and drink at The Brass Rail in Hoboken, N.J., on Nov. 11, 2020. (AP)\n\nHow COVID-19 can spread in restaurants\n\nDining outdoors is safer than dining indoors, the CDC says, and restaurants with spaced out tables and limited guests are less risky than restaurants that aren\u2019t keeping patrons apart.\n\nThe virus is mostly spread from close physical contact, when people are exposed to respiratory droplets sent into the air as an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs or breathes.\n\nBut there\u2019s growing evidence that infections may have also come from tiny airborne particles, especially in \"enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation,\" the CDC says. Shaman cited one recent study from South Korean researchers that looked at airborne spread in a restaurant.\n\nThe researchers examined the origins of one June cluster at a restaurant in the city of JeonJu. They found that, because of the way air was circulated in the restaurant, one person contracted the virus after just five minutes of exposure to an infected diner more than 20 feet away.\n\nOther studies have indicated indoor spaces carry higher risks of spread. The Atlantic highlighted one that showed the odds of transmission were nearly 20 times higher in closed spaces than in open-air environments. Landon shared with PolitiFact a powerpoint created for Illinois officials that listed several other studies, such as one examining an early outbreak on a cruise ship.\n\nRestaurants can reduce the chance of virus spread. Shaman recommended that they minimize or end indoor dining, limit tables and space them out, require waiters to wear gloves and masks, increase ventilation and keep surfaces clean. He also suggested that restaurants take down contact information for those who dine in case contact tracing needs to be performed.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIngraham said, \"You know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID. There's no science for that.\"\n\nIn fact, plenty of evidence suggests restaurant dining has helped spread the coronavirus. Places that allow indoor dining and don\u2019t follow safety protocols are considered especially unsafe.\n\nWe rate Ingraham\u2019s statement False.\n\nRELATED: Laura Ingraham wrong about 'no real scientific basis' for social distancing", "date": "2020/12/08", "false_statement": " \u201cYou know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID.

Yes, according to an infectious diseases expert who presented a webinar to members of the American Hospitals Association.\n\nBut a story being shared on social media ominously refers to \"leaked documents\" and carries an alarmist headline that makes it sound as though hospitals are secretly preparing for an outbreak of that size:\n\n\"U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal,\" reads a March 7, 2020, headline on an article from the Daily Mail, a British newspaper.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOne expert addressing an American Hospital Association webinar estimated there could be 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States.\n\nBut there isn\u2019t evidence to indicate that American hospitals are covertly preparing for an outbreak of this magnitude, as the original headline implies.\n\nWhat\u2019s been reported\n\nThe Daily Mail says the \"leaked documents\" were obtained by Business Insider. When we contacted the Daily Mail for this fact-check, a spokesman said the headline would be changed. The headline was changed to: \"US hospitals should prepare for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal.\" That is, \"are preparing\" was changed to \"should,\" but the leaked documents reference remained.\n\nBusiness Insider, a U.S.-based news website, also used \"leaked\" in the headline of its article, which requires a subscription to access.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that it obtained slides from a webinar on COVID-19, the disease caused by the current coronavirus, that was hosted by the American Hospital Association on Feb. 26, 2020.\n\nThe article said one slide, presented by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases expert and internal medicine professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. He is director of international programs and innovation at its Global Center for Health Security.\n\nLawler, who has treated patients infected with the coronavirus who have been evacuated from China, estimated there could be as many 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States.\n\n\"Overall, the slide points out that hospitals should prepare for an impact to the system that's 10 times a severe flu season,\" the Business Insider story says.\n\nThe hospital association confirmed to Business Insider that the slides it reported on were authentic. It said that the information represented the views of the experts who participated, not the association.\n\nThe association told us the same thing. It did not respond to our questions about whether hospitals are preparing for coronavirus in the numbers estimated by Lawler.\n\nNo other American mainstream news media have reported on the estimates, according to a Nexis search.\n\nThough clearly, with such guidance, hospitals are preparing for a large outbreak. A separate March 7, 2020, story about Lawler\u2019s estimates in another United Kingdom-based newspaper, The Independent, said Lawler \"advised hospitals to prepare\" for an outbreak of this size. That\u2019s a different tone than is implied by the Daily Mail headline.\n\n\"I HOPE hospitals are preparing for this,\" Lawler told PolitiFact by email. \"Word is percolating through groundswell of professional networks as people hear ground truth from Italy, but I am afraid official sources for information are way behind.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe original post said, \"U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal.\"\n\nOne expert estimated at an American Hospital Association webinar that there could be 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States.\n\nBut these supposedly \"leaked\" documents were slides presented by one epidemiologist during a webinar to members of the American Hospital Association. They don\u2019t represent some official attempt to conceal information, as the original Daily Mail headline, later changed, suggests. They also don\u2019t provide evidence that hospitals are preparing for coronavirus cases in those numbers, though clearly this information is being used as guidance for hospitals\u2019 preparations.\n\nThe statement is not accurate.
